muc_multitask_ner : clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ? the u.s. strategy , implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country 's vital centers , as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive. bustillo states it clearly. the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command. through an act of genocide , it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were. bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive. bustillo acknowledges the fmln 's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict. a political solution would express the consensus among the country 's major sectors. obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people 's wish for democracy. in this effort , he lashes out at the catholic church , all opposition sectors that report human rights violations , and all sectors that support democratizing the country. in conclusion , we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition. the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia , vides , and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states : to stop the fmln. the fmln offensive bared the genocidal , antipopular , and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid. the jesuits ' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents. however , the bush administration accepted this , since colonel rene emilio ponce ( chairman of the joints chiefs of staff ) and his clique , even cristiani , must shoulder this responsibility. we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings. bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid. bustillo is bush 's scapegoat. however , bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active. will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy ? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador. while peoples of the world tear down dogmas , dictatorships , and walls , bustillo , who leaves through the door of defeat , asks the armed forces to be tougher , commit more genocide , and build more walls of repression against the church , the people , and the nation as a whole. goodbye , gen. bustillo. we continue writing history without you. the decade we begin is of democracy , independence , and self-determination. that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country , where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings .

muc_multitask_coref : clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ?

muc_multitask_relation : rome ( italy ) , 11 jan 90 -- ( interview with democratic convergence leader ruben zamora by alessandro oppes ) ( excerpt ) ( passage omitted ) ( oppes ) the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) has described the arrest of [ five soldiers ] accused of committing the massacre ( of six jesuit priests ) as " a manipulated cover operation. " basically , cristiani is alleged to have decided to punish a number of low-ranking officers to close the case as quickly as possible and to end international pressures. what is your opinion in this regard ? ( zamora ) the fact that president cristiani acknowledges that members of the [ army ] were responsible for the massacre is a first step and definitely a good thing , but it is entirely insufficient unless the subsequent steps are also taken. first , to identify who the responsible parties were : this is the first important point , because nobody can feel satisfied if only low-ranking officers are identified. such an act can only have been ordered by high-ranking officers. we must not forget the murder of monsignor romero , for which there were no sentences and no trials. ( oppes ) however , the armed forces high command immediately denied involvement in the operation , stating that it was an isolated action " divorced from any institutional policy. " ( zamora ) i believe this is entirely wrong : the murder of the jesuit fathers can not be considered an isolated action. over 7,000 people have died in el salvador during 10 years of civil war , and 90 percent of them were civilians. political assassination by the government forces is a constant practice. furthermore , torture is regularly practised in el salvador. the army high command can not fail to know this. they can not claim to be innocent , because they have the greatest responsibilities for human rights violations. ( oppes ) yet last month the summit of central american heads of state in san jose ended with a success for president cristiani , who secured an explicit condemnation of the offensive launched by the guerrillas in november , whereas no specific charges were leveled at the government for human rights violations. ( zamora ) there is a positive factor that should be borne in mind , namely , the call from the five presidents for a resumption of the dialogue in el salvador and the appeal to the un secretary general to carry out mediation to this end. but in the summit 's final document , it is the fmln and the nicaraguan contras who pay the price for the agreement among the presidents : these are diplomatic games that do not facilitate the restoration of peace in central america. ( oppes ) what paths can be taken now to advance the negotiations ? ( zamora ) negotiations are becoming increasingly necessary. the guerrilla offensive shows that the fmln is a strong military force , but also that a revolutionary attitude does not exist among the masses. it also shows that the government army , after 10 years of u.s. training , is an army whose military stance is defensive , not offensive ( which is the key to u.s. military strategy. ) while this all shows that there can only be a negotiated solution to the crisis , it is also true that precisely following the guerrilla offensive ( and this is the paradox ) the army stiffened its stance against negotiations. i believe that sooner or later common sense will prevail and it will sit down at the negotiating table. at the end of november the u.s. secretary of state 's assistant for latin america spoke officially for the first time about the need for negotiations to resolve the crisis in el salvador : this is an important sign of a changing situation .

mucevent_argument : clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it [ murdered | trigger for attack event ] 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ? the u.s. strategy , implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country 's vital centers , as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive. bustillo states it clearly. the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command. through an act of genocide , it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were. bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive. bustillo acknowledges the fmln 's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict. a political solution would express the consensus among the country 's major sectors. obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people 's wish for democracy. in this effort , he lashes out at the catholic church , all opposition sectors that report human rights violations , and all sectors that support democratizing the country. in conclusion , we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition. the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia , vides , and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states : to stop the fmln. the fmln offensive bared the genocidal , antipopular , and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid. the jesuits ' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents. however , the bush administration accepted this , since colonel rene emilio ponce ( chairman of the joints chiefs of staff ) and his clique , even cristiani , must shoulder this responsibility. we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings. bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid. bustillo is bush 's scapegoat. however , bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active. will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy ? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador. while peoples of the world tear down dogmas , dictatorships , and walls , bustillo , who leaves through the door of defeat , asks the armed forces to be tougher , commit more genocide , and build more walls of repression against the church , the people , and the nation as a whole. goodbye , gen. bustillo. we continue writing history without you. the decade we begin is of democracy , independence , and self-determination. that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country , where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings .

mucevent_trigger : clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ? the u.s. strategy , implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country 's vital centers , as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive. bustillo states it clearly. the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command. through an act of genocide , it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were. bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive. bustillo acknowledges the fmln 's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict. a political solution would express the consensus among the country 's major sectors. obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people 's wish for democracy. in this effort , he lashes out at the catholic church , all opposition sectors that report human rights violations , and all sectors that support democratizing the country. in conclusion , we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition. the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia , vides , and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states : to stop the fmln. the fmln offensive bared the genocidal , antipopular , and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid. the jesuits ' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents. however , the bush administration accepted this , since colonel rene emilio ponce ( chairman of the joints chiefs of staff ) and his clique , even cristiani , must shoulder this responsibility. we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings. bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid. bustillo is bush 's scapegoat. however , bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active. will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy ? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador. while peoples of the world tear down dogmas , dictatorships , and walls , bustillo , who leaves through the door of defeat , asks the armed forces to be tougher , commit more genocide , and build more walls of repression against the church , the people , and the nation as a whole. goodbye , gen. bustillo. we continue writing history without you. the decade we begin is of democracy , independence , and self-determination. that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country , where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings .

mucevent_trigger : clandestine , 8 jan 90 ( radio venceremos ) -- ( station commentary ) ( text ) goodbye ( air force commander ) general rafael bustillo , false hope for mass killers. gen. bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief. because of this , the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador 's neighborhoods the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces. bustillo 's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador , as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november. for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice. this first happened in the interior of the country , with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo , berlin , torola , san fernando , and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto , sunpul , and ocotapayo. bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have. and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power 's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador. as all the others who have left , bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure , by accusing others. he accuses ( former defense minister eugenio ) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people 's plan. one would have to ask bustillo if the air force , of which he represented its most encouraging pillar , was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans , monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included , and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army. was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $ 3 billion , weapons , and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century ? the u.s. strategy , implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country 's vital centers , as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive. bustillo states it clearly. the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command. through an act of genocide , it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were. bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive. bustillo acknowledges the fmln 's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict. a political solution would express the consensus among the country 's major sectors. obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people 's wish for democracy. in this effort , he lashes out at the catholic church , all opposition sectors that report human rights violations , and all sectors that support democratizing the country. in conclusion , we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition. the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia , vides , and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states : to stop the fmln. the fmln offensive bared the genocidal , antipopular , and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid. the jesuits ' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents. however , the bush administration accepted this , since colonel rene emilio ponce ( chairman of the joints chiefs of staff ) and his clique , even cristiani , must shoulder this responsibility. we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings. bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid. bustillo is bush 's scapegoat. however , bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active. will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy ? time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador. while peoples of the world tear down dogmas , dictatorships , and walls , bustillo , who leaves through the door of defeat , asks the armed forces to be tougher , commit more genocide , and build more walls of repression against the church , the people , and the nation as a whole. goodbye , gen. bustillo. we continue writing history without you. the decade we begin is of democracy , independence , and self-determination. that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country , where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings .

mucevent_trigger : san salvador , 19 mar 89 ( radio cadena sonora ) -- ( communique ) ( farabundo marti national liberation front general command ) ( text ) esteemed members of the government commission : today , 9 march , we have received a message signed by the members of your commission asking us to begin the peace talks. we have already addressed this issue on numerous occasions , expressing our willingness to hold a meeting. the government commission 's letter makes no mention of any move to postpone the elections. it does not even consider including this topic on the meeting 's agenda. on the contrary , it is clear that the commission has already decided to hold the elections on 19 march. consequently , the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) hereby informs the government commission and the salvadoran people of the following : 1. the government commission must clearly and publicly announce that it is willing to reach an agreement on confining the army to its barracks on the day of the elections , establishing an electoral code by consensus , providing absentee voting for salvadorans living abroad , restructuring the central elections council , and forming a council for verification. more importantly , it must express the state powers ' willingness to postpone the elections for 5 months , once a cease-fire has been agreed upon. we also believe that the government commission must publicly announce that it is willing to bring military commanders and officers responsible for political murders and crimes to trial , to reduce the salvadoran armed forces to the number of troops it had in 1968 , and to disband the security forces to form a new civil police. we reiterate our willingness to discuss permanently ceasing the armed struggle. 2. if the government commission agrees to the above requests , the fmln will agree to a meeting and is willing to immediately decide on a date and a time for the meeting. the fmln is even willing to hold the meeting outside el salvador. as a part of this meeting , we are willing to negotiate and come to an agreement with the armed forces staff on a cease-fire that will bring about a permanent and negotiated solution to the conflict. 3. if no such agreement is reached , then there is no point in holding the meeting prior to 19 march , because it will simply be used by both the christian democratic party ( pdc ) and the nationalist republican alliance ( arena ) in their election dispute. the elections play no role in achieving peace ; they only serve to provide a false justification for continuing the war. 4. we await a response from the government commission. el salvador , 9 march 1989 fmln general command ( signed ) commander salvador sanchez ceren commander francisco jovel commander jorge shafik handal commander eduardo sancho commander joaquin villalobos
