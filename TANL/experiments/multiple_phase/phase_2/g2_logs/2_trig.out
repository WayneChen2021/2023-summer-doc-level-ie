san salvador , 4 apr 89 ( acan-efe ) -- ( text ) el salvador 's supreme court of justice has relieved judge hector larios of his duties as judge and notary because he ordered the release of a band of alleged kidnappers. the new judge , ricardo mejia , overturned the ruling to release the eight people accused of kidapping at least six wealthy salvadorans in the early 1980's. supreme court chief justice francisco jose guerrero announced larios ' dismissal and suspended his license to practice law. " based on a review of larios ' irregular ruling , one can conclude that his behavior is unbecoming an official worthy of the supreme court 's trust. we are dismayed by that judge 's conduct , " he noted. moreover , mejia overturned the ruling ordering the release of orlando llovera ballet , lieutenant isidro lopez , major alfredo jimenez , and other members of the kidnapping ring. larios decided on friday to release the members of the kidnapping ring , which included some army officers and sympathizers of the rightist nationalist republican alliance ( arena ) , which won the 19 march presidential elections. " this is the first time the supreme court has levied this kind of sanction in a case setting a precedent in judicial corruption , " a court official asserted , referring to larios ' dismissal. larios is also accused of releasing members of a drug trafficking ring some years ago. because the ruling on the kidnappers was overturned , " the case goes back to the lower courts , " the new judge said. the kidnappers , some of whom have been under arrest since april 1986 , were accused of kidnapping several businessmen for high sums of money. larios 's ruling in favor of the kidnappers prompted a bitter reaction from government , political , and professional sectors. the national ad council , representing news media announcers , has urged that the kidnappers be prosecuted to the full extent of the law " so that those who profit from the suffering of others are punished .
