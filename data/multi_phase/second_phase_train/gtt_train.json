        "doctext": "   tegucigalpa, 3 aug 89 (cadena audio video) -- [report] [miriam mercado] [excerpts] ramon custodio lopez, president of the human rights defense committee [codeh] has predicted that the tela summit will be chaotic because, in his opinion, the honduran and salvadoran governments will interfere.  the codeh president also revealed that the battalion 3-16's new name is the counterinsurgency battalion and its commander is colonel alberto andino benitez.  custodio said this during the news conference he held 2 august.     [begin recording] [custodio] we have called this news conference because we want to warn the people, the foreign journalists who are here, and the other central american presidents about the atmosphere of insecurity which afflicts the honduran people.     first of all, we will mention the assassinations which occurred in july at san pedro sula: eduardo herrera, salomon vallecillo, and dr ramon roberto garay.  we believe that the assassinations were perpetrated by professionals so we would like a judge to call the new commander of battalion 3-16 -- now called counterinsurgency battalion -- colonel alberto andino benitez to testify.  there are reports that a member of the 3-16th battalion contacted salomon vallecillo prior to his death.     likewise, i want to mention how the citizenry is exposed to police brutality.  there is the case of justo pastor escobar silva, who was assassinated by a fusep [public security forces] agent who is now serving a prison sentence.     furthermore, people feel insecure in the country, and i will mention a case which occurred 3 weeks ago.  dr marco antonio bogran was taken with all his household employees to the dni [department of national investigation] and held from 0800 to 1500.  he was not allowed to call his lawyer or his relatives, and he was held in isolation.  he was naturally afraid the worst would happen.  no one explained anything until the end.  he was told that someone had reportedly made a subversive phone call from his house.  this means that his telephone is being illegally tapped because no one here has the right to control anyone's calls. the military men in charge of hondutel [honduran telecommunications enterprise] illegally abuse their power when they hear and control telephone calls because this should be handled by the civilian authorities.  [passage omitted] [end recording]     colonel manuel enrique suarez benavides, chief of the armed forces public relations office, has reacted to custodio lopez' statement.     [begin recording] [col suarez] i have heard part of ramon custodio's news conference on codeh foreign policy, and we observed his animosity toward the contras and his affection for the farabundo marti national liberation front in el salvador.  we thought he only handled human rights but we see he also delves in foreign policy. however, this is not the main issue.     i want to refer to the fact that years ago we publicly proved that battalion 3-16, which he mentioned so many times, had been dismantled so the unit no longer exists.  nevertheless, he seems to have forgotten this, or he may be intentionally forgetting this.  the unit disappeared but the counterintelligence battalion he mentions does exist and its commander, which he mentions, is a member of the armed forces.  in other words, he has absolutely nothing to do with the activities that battalion 3-16 reportedly carried out.  if custodio wants it, we can send him a copy of the agreements to dismantle battalion 3-16 and to appoint the current commander of the counterintelligence battalion, which has existed for many years.  that is all.  i wanted to clarify this and i hope dr custodio is more objective in his statements.  i sometimes believe that the problem of being on one side [words indistinct] the mind.     [reporter] colonel, when will the armed forces be able to give the honduran people exact information on the latest people who have been reported missing in our country?     [col suarez] excuse me, i can hardly hear you.     [reporter] i asked: when can the honduran people have exact information on the people who have been reported missing in the country?     [col suarez] look, we believe that we will shortly, and i am talking about a short time, have enough information for the honduran people on the persons you have mentioned because the investigations continue.  the police arrest people based on the suspicion or hard, rational evidence that they are involved in criminal actions.  i believe you will soon have enough information on the persons who have been arrested by the police.

[begin recording] [d'aubuisson, in progress] ... fallacies. this is not the first time they have claimed to want something and ended up doing something different.  they are going to try to improve their international image and do not want to look like [word indistinct] before the little mangy-dogs who go about planting bombs here.  they want to demonstrate perhaps that they always hold a hegemonic position here and will try to obtain a better negotiating position for their illegal forces, which are still going around [word indistinct] and killing people [words indistinct].     [castillo] nevertheless, major, do you view this meeting as positive [word indistinct] with the fmln -- that is, the dialogue -- now that something tangible has come out of the summit?  do you think peace can be achieved?     [d'aubuisson] the objective of all salvadorans -- and in this regard we speak from the heart -- is to achieve peace.  if the fmln cooperates, we welcome its cooperation.  however, if it does not cooperate, there will be fmln members who will demobilize, the same way so many people from the [word indistinct] are deserting.  these people had to be given guarantees.  we will see later if, as they say, they are truly working, or struggling, for the salvadoran people [words indistinct] more positive actions.     however, we see everything as being well on the way to achieving peace in a short time.  [end recording]     d'aubuisson said that if the fmln does not agree to the demobilization, the fmln members will be solely responsible if peace is not achieved. regarding the commission, he said it is already being organized and will begin a dialogue soon.     [begin recording] [d'aubuisson, in progress] ...a continuous dialogue to find solutions.  that is why president cristiani has instructed that it have no prior agenda but that it just begin.  their first step should be to sit down at a table to talk, to negotiate, to engage in dialogue.  and this is to go on continuously until solutions are found and they achieve something tangible, which is the final solution.     [reporter] [words indistinct]      [d'aubuisson] well, for example, costa rican president arias has offered to act as mediator or intermediary.  he said that if the commission goes to san jose, he will take it upon himself to invite these gentlemen too and to give them whatever they need for this meeting to begin.  after that, they themselves will develop the mechanisms.  [end recording]     maj d'aubuisson said the commission will be sworn in and will maintain an ongoing dialogue with the fmln representatives.     commenting on legislative work, he said that today the political committee will meet to elect the president of the commission on corruption, which had been substantially neglected by dr jaime ventura.  the only candidate for the presidency of the commission on corruption is deputy roberto angulo, vice president and acting president of the legislative assembly.",

        "doctext": "   moscow (ussr), 28 aug 89 -- [text] in view of the recent incidents at tobalaba airport, the communist party of chile [pcch] has issued the following communique:     the dictatorship intends to use still unclear incidents that took place a few days ago at tobalaba airport to create a climate of provocation and alarm with the purpose of disrupting the development of the political process that should lead to a democratic victory on 14 december.     pinochet's open intervention in the development of the electoral process remained clear in his 23 august speech and was recently denounced by opposition leader patricio aylwin and by all opposition political forces.     the declaration issued by the national intelligence center, cni -- an organization that for many years has shamefully violated the most basic rights of the chilean people by using the most cruel and inhuman forms of terror and violence against chilean democrats and whose dissolution has been proposed even by the government's candidate hernan buchi -- intends to misguide the people by once again trying to implicate the pcch in an incident in which it had no participation whatsoever.     the cni declaration, expressly ordered by authorities of the regime, goes to the extreme of infamously manipulating family ties to attack our general secretary, comrade volodia teitelboim.     the regime seeks to create a climate of terror and intimidation in order to impose the antidemocratic demands recently made by pinochet.     to this end, and as pinochet himself has stated, the regime is willing even to resort to force once again.  part of this plan is the murder of luis vargas, who was arrested and tortured by the cni and later thrown out of a fifth- floor window of the military court building after being falsely charged with having an arsenal in his home; the scandalous court decision that leaves unpunished those responsible for the inhuman death of rodrigo rojas denegri and the serious injury of carmen gloria quintana; the shameful supreme court decision clearing those responsible for the horrible crimes against 10 chileans in late 1976; the regime's intention to impose a new amnesty law to leave thousands of cases of violation of human rights in the past 16 years unpunished; the arrest and incommunicado detention of 13 people, among them a pregnant woman allegedly involved in the incidents at the tobalaba airport and for whose physical and psychological integrity we fear.     this is the consequence of pinochet, the cni, and the circles close to the dictatorship's despair in view of the progress made by the democratic struggle and the growing unity of all oposition forces around a single presidential candidate and a common platform designed to democratize the country.     as always when it feels threatened, the dictatorship has decided to divide and confuse the opposition forces.     we appeal to all democrats to come together even more firmly so the level of unity achieved by the opposition sector will not allow such maneuvers to jeopardize the resolute progress toward the much desired democracy and freedom for our people.     we also urge that this provocation be denounced by doubling efforts to overwhelmingly defeat the dictatorship on 14 december, thus taking a decisive step in the struggle to definitively oust this regime of hatred, death, and pain.     signed: americo zorrilla, jaime insunza, and carlos molinas for the communist party of chile.

[begin recording] [shahal] it is absolutely true.  israel trained colombian defense establishment elements; this was done in the customary way and with the approval of the defense minister.  colombia bought security products from israel, such as the kfir planes, which were the other side of the coal purchase.  on the day i met with the colombian president he signed an order approving the purchase of the kfir planes by the colombian air force.  a day later we signed the coal agreement.  the total value of the deal was about $200 to $250 million for each side.

[ojeda] eight or nine people have arrived at the red cross--we do not have the exact number--including a woman.  there is one dead person who has not been identified since he has no identification papers.     [announcer] so one person has died.     [ojeda] among the injured here are heriberto lopez gonzalez, 53; jaime orlando suarez, 24; noralba beltran, 23; gloria carranza, 25; leon alvaro vitorino, 32; daniel mantilla, 26; maritza martinez, 38; gladys paez; pedro ortiz, abel portillo, and carmen rosa gutierrez.     [announcer] you said there is one dead person.  had he died before he arrived at the red cross or did he die at the red cross.     [ojeda] he is a young man, who has no identification papers.     [announcer] do you have any reports on the injured?     [ojeda] they are badly injured.  some are slightly injured but there are others badly injured.     thank you mrs ojeda.",

[begin recording] [montano] the national dialogue committee's proposal is a good one and the armed forces applauds it, and is in a position to accept it, as long as the fmln also complies with it. [end recording]     speaking at a news conference, col montano said that the maimed fmln fighters' presence at the metropolitan cathedral is an indication that fmln leaders abandon their fighters when they cease to be useful.     [begin recording] [montano] i believe that if the fmln wanted to send those people abroad, as they have done in the past, they could very well have done so.  they have the fighters at the cathedral for propaganda purposes, and to give the impression that the government is inhumane.  i have even read and heard statements by fmln allies who say that the situation of the maimed cannot be negotiated for humanitarian reasons.  however, did they display humaneness when they burned buses, left the people without electricity, or destroyed so many things that benefit the public? [end recording]     referring to the homily delivered yesterday by monsignor gregorio rosa chavez, auxiliary bishop of san salvador, who accused the air force of bombing the santa elena church in usulutan department, col montano said that some leftist clergymen distort the facts for propaganda purposes.

[de greiff] the decrees were being studied since noon on the day of his death.  it had been a very tough week.  the magistrate and the colonel had been murdered; galan was murdered that evening.  there was much discussion over the drafts, but i believe that the attack on galan hurried things up.     in the case of the extradition decree, we were all aware that it was not a popular measure.  philosophically, most ministers did not like the idea of colombians being tried abroad.  there was much legal discussion, not only to do with this case, but also over the new measures concerning raids, seizures, and arrests.     however, finally there was a great determination to give the country answers.     [reporter] the country's current problems have much to do with the extradition decree.     [de greiff] we must not forget that these measures are not against a group of people, but against violence.  extradition has been a very tough measure for everyone.  the inconveniences and the legality of this decree, as well as the possible reactions against it, were discussed a great deal.  it can be that part of the violence generated has been due to the extradition decree.     [reporter] is it possible to begin a dialogue with the drug traffickers as a way of ending the country's violence?     [de greiff] the government said no to the dialogue, but we must wait and see how events develop.  i do not believe that a government's decision can be strict, because situations do change.  the president has said that dialogue is impossible.  you never know, things may change in the future.     anyway, in colombia practically no wars have ended, because in nearly all wars an agreement was reached.     [reporter] but if colombia holds a dialogue, the world's doors will probably close on colombia.     [de greiff] look, in the united states i was asked about the extradition and i said it was not popular, that it was not going to solve the drug trafficking problem.  it is not the government's stance, but if it is decided to hold a dialogue, then this would be a sovereign colombian decision.  obviously, if the position changes a bad impression will be given.     the government has been very clear that it has not lost its sovereignty.     [reporter] the internatinal press feels a little disappointed with your resignation.  one must not forget that you became a symbol for the foreign journalists when you traveled to washington.     [de greiff] i held a news conference on 22 september and i told them that my resignation was not monica de greiff's position, but the government's.  i told them i was staying in the country, and i explained to them that the ministers here remain at their posts until the president decides otherwise.  however, they did not understand why.     [reporter] what will monica de greiff do?     [de greiff] i am going to rest for a few days and then return.  i am going to help ernesto samper's campaign.  i also believe that working for private enterprise will be a good opportunity.     [reporter] what post has given you the greatest satisfaction?     [de greiff] when i was at the ministry of mines and energy. it was fascinating.  i had two very good bosses: guillermo perry and oscar mejia.  i worked in delightful harmony with a group of good people.  i believe that mining and hydrocarbons is the sector that has enjoyed the greatest progress under this government.     [reporter] what is your final feeling upon leaving the ministry?     [de greiff] every cloud has a silver lining.  i have been spared from many boring things.  i have not had to sign extradition orders or things like that.  without realizing it, i have been spared of tiring things.",

[applause]     i am also here at the united nations to present to you the crude reality of this war against drug trafficking.  colombia is on the frontline of this battle.  for us it is not a war of words.  many colombians have died because of their firm commitment against drug trafficking.  approximately 1 month ago, luis carlos galan, one of the most prestigious political leaders in my country, was assassinated. his death has consolidated even more the nation's will and has drawn the world's attention to the problem.  however, many colombians have died over the years -- as he did -- as victim of drug trafficking. that long list includes 12 magistrates of the supreme court, an attorney general, and a justice minister.  prominent congressmen, judges, mayors, journalists, thousands of soldiers, policemen, and colombian citizens have given their lives for democracy.     last month, after announcing exceptional measures against drug trafficking, which were decreed by the government in accordance with the state of siege, drug traffickers have continued and intensified their terrorist actions.
