I THEREFORE WANTED TO\nCONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW\nTHEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.\n\n   FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC\nAGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO\nTACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO\nMEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS,\nTHESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE\nPROBLEM.

YET\nWHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL\nCHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING\nTHAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN\nNATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE\nTHE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.\n\n   GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF\nADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF\nTREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES,\nFATHERLAND, OR LAW.\n\n   CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE\nINSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS\nMADE IN ALL FIELDS.\n\n   THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES\nHAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE\nSHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW\nCOUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A\nLIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED.

MANY TIMES YOU HAVE\nHEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A\nWORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO\nHAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR\nOWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF\nLOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE\nGREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,\nUNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,\nAND WELL-BEING.\n\n   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE\nCONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD\nMEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A\nFEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL\nPRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,\nAND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.\nPERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE\nNOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE\nISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO\nMONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE\nPRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,\nESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.\n\n   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN\nGENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE\nSUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A\nGOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS\nAVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO\nIMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET\nUS THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN\nFAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO\nBENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO\nBUY A VEHICLE.\n\n   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS\nEXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,\nWHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS\nCAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE\nLITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE\nHAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.\nMOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT\nPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES\nTO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE\nCURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --\nTHROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN\nNOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO\nPRICE INCREASE.\n\n   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE\nGAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES\nARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE\nSOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR\nNOTHING AT ALL.\n\n   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF\nSOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS\nTHE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE\nLOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT\nCHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE\nMUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT\nFIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN\nEFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.\n\n   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE\nCHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS\nTO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO\nSENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING\nHAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE\nSHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.\n\n   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET\nDISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO\nLONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO\nSUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO\nSEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND\nACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR\nCOUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE\nPHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL\nSALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT\nTHOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.\n\n   THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF\nTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR\nSOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS\nKNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN\nCOME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND\nMAY GOD BLESS YOU.

ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY\nGERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE\nOF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR\nTWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO\nEXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE\nBRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,\nWHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.\nPALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING\nTHE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.\n\n   THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO\nGROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE\nSECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO\nVIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS\nTHAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO\nBENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION.\nTHE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE\nPALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE\nSUPPLIER.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO\nDO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE\nCORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM\nSMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE\nSTOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS\nMORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS\nINVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY\nOF DRUGS EVERY DAY.\n\n   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF\nTHEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY\nFOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS\nCARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE\nFOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN\nTRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,\nARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS\nOF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES\nTHE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN\nBOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO\nSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO\nFOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE\nTRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),\nNEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES\nOF COCAINE.\n\n   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE\nDRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND\nACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE\nLARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF\nDRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN\nBY LAW.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ\nREGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,\nAND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE\nTRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,\nAND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.

A SIGN OF THIS WAS\nTHE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD\nINDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE\nGROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A\nMILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS.\nTHOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING\nOF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY\nWOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY\nPATH.

ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED\nTHAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF\nEVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL\nSALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.\nIN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.\nON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD\nTURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT\nVIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS\nMEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A\nCOMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED\nOF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.\nTHIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE\nMILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT\nTO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT\nTHE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A\nCOUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING\nTO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL\nDESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH\nTHAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.

THE REPORT ADDS\nTHAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.\n\n   SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN\nVARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE\nMAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY\nENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH\nTHE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.\n\n   PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE\nCAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE\nIS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS\nSHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR\nPOSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.\n\n   WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT\nSOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.

IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN\nFIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE\nREGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS\nINCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A\nSTATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN\nSALVADOR.\n\n   ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON\nTHE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS\nNEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO\nNEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS\nIS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE\nANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE\nPEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT\nBY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.\n\n   COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG.\nYOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY\nOUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS\nSAID.\n\n   COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS\nYOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR\nCOOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN\nSALVADOR.

  SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH\nSALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MILTON GRIMALDI] [TEXT]\nPRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST\nSALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS.\nHE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A\nCOMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING\nWORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION.\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE\nTHE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI\nCONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL\nROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK\nTHIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE\nFMLN:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT\nWANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN\nCOMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS\nONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,\nINVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE\nHAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHIS ACTION.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE\nCOMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH\nACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.\nTHEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR\nPEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nAND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS\nFOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.\n\n   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE\nWILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL\nACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE\nCOMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION\nIS FULLY FORMED.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS\nCOMMISSION?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE\nREPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION\nAND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE\nCHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS\nTO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD\nTHIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO\nPLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE\nPOLITICAL COMMISSION.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE\nENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR\nINABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE\nOF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE\nHAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF\nGOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER\nWAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT\nOFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC\nFINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN\nVERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE\nLAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM.

  CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN\nCOMMANDER GONZALEZ BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]\n[REPORTER] COMMANDER, WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT, THE LABOR

GUARANTEE TO THE POPULAR\nMOVEMENT?  WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO?\n\n   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL\nTHE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT.  THROUGH REPRESSION\nIT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS\nRESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI\nGOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NO\nALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED\nACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION,\nARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND\nSOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE\nREGIME.\n\n   THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO\nDEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS.

THE ARMED FORCES AND THE\nGOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE\nATTACKS.\n\n   [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL\nMOTIVATIONS.  OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY.  ALL OUR GUERRILLA\nUNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS\nOR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE.\n\n   THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER\nOPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THE\nFMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR\nPOLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE\nHERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE\nPOLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.

THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA\nAREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR\nMISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES\nTHAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE\nTHE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL\nLANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS\nPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE\nCRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]\n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE\nFMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS\nTOWARD A DIALOGUE?\n\n   [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE\nBEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO\nTALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A\nPOSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN\nAN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS\nREPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT\nTHE FMLN.\n\n   BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE\nINFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED\nAND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A\nLARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25\nANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12\nCARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS,\n45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23\nRADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.\n\n   I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH\nSUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.\n\n   I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN\nABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE\nALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION.\n\n   WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF\nYOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL\nAS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE\nNUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS\nTHAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.\n\n   [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A\nLEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND\nALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.

GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS\nTHE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT\nWITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE\nSALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN\nOF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL\nSALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.\n\n   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE\nAIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE\nDEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,\nTOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE\nGENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN\nEL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS\nAND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE\nIMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN\nEL SALVADOR.\n\n   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE\nOF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER\nEUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE\nWOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS\nMOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,\nMONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT\nMURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT\nWHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF\nGENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?\n\n   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE\nPAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT\nREBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED\nHAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.\n\n   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN\nACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE\nNEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES\nGENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO\nACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE\nTOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR\nSECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.\nBUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR\nDEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL\nOPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT\nSUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS\nNOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS\nIT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT\nTHEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:\nTO STOP THE FMLN.\n\n   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF\nTHE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG\nDEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS\nAND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING\nFOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN\nOF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER\nTHIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN\nDEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.\n\n   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL\nBEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S\nSCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS\nMACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE\nAPPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE\nOBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES\nOF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO\nLEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,\nCOMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,\nTHE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE\nWRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,\nINDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND\nTHE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE\nPEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY\nBOMBINGS.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0004 (NCCOSC)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"1 (OPTIONAL)","INCIDENT: DATE":"- 08 JAN 90","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"EL SALVADOR","INCIDENT: TYPE":"ATTACK","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"ACCOMPLISHED","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"-","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"-","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"-","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"\"AIR FORCE\"","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"REPORTED AS FACT: \"AIR FORCE\"","PHYS TGT: ID":"-","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"-","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"-","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"-","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-","HUM TGT: NAME":"\"ARNULFO ROMERO\"","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"\"MONSIGNOR\": \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; \"SALVADORANS\"; \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"","HUM TGT: TYPE":"CIVILIAN: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"; CIVILIAN: \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; CIVILIAN: \"SALVADORANS\"","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"1: \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; 70000: \"SALVADORANS\"; PLURAL: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"DEATH: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"; DEATH: \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; DEATH: \"SALVADORANS\"","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.037138Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T21:11:46.435418Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42194,"annotations":[{"id":1723,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-08T21:11:56.155389Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T21:11:56.155426Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.717,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42194,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":2400,"completed_by":8,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-20T16:21:18.679477Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T16:21:18.679512Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.749,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42194,"project":14,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":2479,"completed_by":11,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-20T17:11:25.279270Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T17:11:25.279304Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.922,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42194,"project":14,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":2502,"completed_by":9,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-20T19:27:24.129013Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T19:27:24.129049Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.552,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42194,"project":14,"updated_by":9,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7c844e1e-dev-muc3-0001-0100.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS)-- [TEXT] A WAR BULLETIN\nINDICATES THAT ON 6 JANUARY AT 1625, FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL\nLIBERATION FRONT] TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE CAVALRY COMPANY IN FINCA\nSANTA ELENA, SANTA TECLA, NEAR SAN SALVADOR, KILLING THREE AND\nWOUNDING FOUR ENEMY TROOPS, INCLUDING THE PATROL LEADER WHO WAS AMONG\nTHOSE KILLED.

INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN\nCOUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED\nSTATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST.  THE SIDE\nEFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE\nCOOPERATING.

THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING\nITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF\nLATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR.\n\n   IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE\nUNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.  THIS MEANS THAT DURING A FIRST PHASE THE UNITED STATES WILL\nCARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION BY ITSELF.  DURING A SECOND PHASE IT WILL\nDISCUSS SECONDARY SUBJECTS BUT WITH LESS URGENCY IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.\n\n   NEXT 15 FEBRUARY, BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH\nHIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS.  PERHAPS ON THAT OCCASION\nTHEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS WAR: THE REORGANIZATION OF\nTHE LOCAL ECONOMIES TO END THE DEPENDENCY ON COCA PLANTATIONS, THE RECOVERY\nOF DRUG ADDICTS, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ETC.\n\n   DURING THIS CURRENT PHASE, HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES WISHES TO ACT ALONE.\nWHO KNOWS IF IT IS BECAUSE OF LATIN AMERICA'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING?  AS WE\nSAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS\nIN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

AND ALL THIS WHILE A\nLARGE PART OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD'S POPULATION IS BECOMING ADDICTED TO A\nDEADLY PRODUCT?\n\n   THE UNITED STATES COULD ALSO BE ASKING ITSELF: HAVE THE LATIN AMERICAN\nGOVERNMENTS BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BY THEMSELVES?  CAN\nTHOSE GOVERNMENTS STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT DRUGS AND\nCORRUPTION GO HAND IN HAND; WHEN IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IN THE PRESENT,\nHIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH THIS ILLEGAL TRADE\nAND PROTECTING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS?  WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THIS\nHASN'T THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO EXTRADITE THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THAT\nCARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES?\n\n   LET US RECALL THE HORRIBLE EXPLOSION OF THE COLOMBIAN AIRLINER, IN WHICH\nMORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED; THE BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE SECRET POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA; THE MURDER OF MANY JOURNALISTS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN\nAN HEROIC WAR AGAINST DRUG

  CLANDESTINE, 11 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL\nCOMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]\n[TEXT] REGARDING THE JESUITS' CASE, THE FMLN STATES THAT:\n\n   1. THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS,\nWERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE\nCRIME.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE\nCASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION],\nMONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.S. AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR\nTHE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE\nWERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP\nTHE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   2. TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE\nTHIS CASE.  THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM\nSHOULD BE PUNISHED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT\nTHE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS.  MOST\nIMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS\nBECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF\nTHE TOP COMMAND.\n\n   3. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS\nCONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE\nOF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND\nORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND\nSTOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS.  \n\n   4. THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED\nDISCUSSIONS ON U.S. AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS\nAID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR.  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE\nRESOLVED.  SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE\nTHAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN.  THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A\nNEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID.  WE APPEAL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MAKE\nTHIS DECISION.  IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING\nEFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.\n\n   5. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING\nPROGRESS.  IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE\nCOULD BE REACHED EARLIER.\n\n   6. TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN\nSECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH\nUS AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE\nDIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS.\n\n   7.

HAS\nDESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE\nMASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS \"A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION.\"\nBASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF\nLOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO\nEND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?\n\n   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF\nTHE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A\nGOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE\nALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS\nTHE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY\nLOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED\nBY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,\nFOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.\n\n   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED\nINVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION\n\"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY.\"\n\n   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT\nFATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE\nDIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE\nCIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT\nPRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE\nARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE\nINNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\nVIOLATIONS.\n\n   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN\nSAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN\nEXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN\nNOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR\nHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.\n\n   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,\nTHE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL\nSALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION\nTO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE\nNICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:\nTHESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE\nIN CENTRAL AMERICA.\n\n   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?\n\n   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA\nOFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A\nREVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE\nMILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.\nMILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A\nNEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING\nTHE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS\nSTANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE\nWILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF\nNOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE\nOFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE\nCRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0022 (NCCOSC)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"1","INCIDENT: DATE":"- 11 JAN 90","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"EL SALVADOR","INCIDENT:

CRISTIANI WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN RESUMING THE TALKS.\nMERINO ADDED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ABANDON THE DELAYING AND IRRESPONSIBLE\nTACTICS REGARDING THE DIALOGUE BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY BOTH IN\nTHE MILITARY SENSE AND IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE FMLN HAS LOST CREDIBILITY IN ALL OF ITS\nACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MILITARY ACTIONS.  THE ONLY VALID ALTERNATIVE TO\nPACIFY THE COUNTRY IS FOR THE REBELS TO STOP HOSTILITIES, VIOLENCE, AND\nTERRORISM.  WE SHOULD JOINTLY EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR JOINING THE\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  [END RECORDING]\n\n   HE ALSO SAID ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES READILY AVAILABLE TO THE FMLN IS TO\nPARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS FOR DELEGATES TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPARLIAMENT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] EL SALVADOR HAS PROPOSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE\nASSEMBLY TO RATIFY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT PROTOCOL.  THIS WOULD\nOPEN THE DOOR FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION OF THE SALVADORAN DELEGATES TO THE\nPARLIAMENT.  IF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC WILLINGNESS BY THE FMLN EXISTS, THIS\nCOULD BE THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE.  IT HAS NOT YET BEEN\nDECIDED WHETHER THIS ELECTION WILL BE HELD BEFORE THE 1991 OFFICIAL\nELECTIONS FOR MAYORS AND DEPUTIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN COULD\nJOINTLY CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF A SPECIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR.  THEN WE\nCOULD MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE 1991 CONSTITUTIONAL ELECTIONS. [END\nRECORDING]\n\n   REGARDING THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS, MERINO SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS\nFAMILIAR WITH THE REBELS' TACTICS, PARTICULARLY WHEN TALKS ARE BEING\nCONSIDERED.  HE ALSO SAID THE REBELS OPERATE IN CYCLES.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER REACTED NAIVELY TO THE\nFMLN TERRORISTS' STATEMENTS OR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  WE ARE\nFULLY AWARE OF THEIR PLANS AND STRATEGIES.  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, BEARS\nTHE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING HARMONY AND THE CITIZENS'S SECURITY.\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   AFTER THE REBELS' COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER, WHICH WAS REGARDED AS THE\nLARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE POSSIBILITY FOR A NEW\nDIALOGUE HAS APPEARED IN EL SALVADOR ONCE MORE, CREATING EXPECTATIONS, BOTH\nHERE AND ABROAD.

THEY ARE TO\nRENEW THEIR SESSIONS IN 2 WEEKS' TIME, AND IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE\nWAITING TO BE DISCUSSED.\n\n   AFTER THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] STARTED ITS 11\nNOVEMBER OFFENSIVE WHICH BURIED THE ARMY'S PROPAGANDISTIC CLAIMS THAT IT HAD\nFINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO\nMILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  ENDING THE YEAR, THE\nWORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.\n\n   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR\nADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI\nHIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE\nJESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT\nTHE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY\nFOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE\nONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.\nTHE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL\nTELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.  [PASSAGE\nINDISTINCT]...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.\n\n   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000\nPEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN\nZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION\nFEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN\nCRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD\nHAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS\nMADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.  \n\n   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,\nIS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA\nRICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE\nNATION WOULD DO SO.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT\nTHE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.\n\n   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE\nIRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN\n$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR\nARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED\nMONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S.\nADVISERS.  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN\nHE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.  THE 10 YEARS OF\nAID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.\nIF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE\nTIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.\n\n   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON\nTHE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT\nFOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?  IT IS A\nDECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.  IT WILL DETERMINE THE\nCONTINUATION OF U.S. AID.  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY\nAROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE TO\nDISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF\nTHE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE\nAS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT\nTHESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.\n\n   WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE\nSALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?  WILL THEY DO THIS\nBY STOPPING MILITARY AID?  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED\nSTATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A\nCOMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.  WE HOPE THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A\nMISTAKE.  IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND\nBEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE.  HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND\nBEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0029 (NCCOSC)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"1","INCIDENT: DATE":"- 12 JAN 90","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"EL SALVADOR","INCIDENT: TYPE":"ATTACK","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"ACCOMPLISHED","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"-","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"-","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"\"ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL\"","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"\"ARMED FORCES\"","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES: \"ARMED FORCES\"","PHYS TGT: ID":"-","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"-","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"-","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"-","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-","HUM TGT: NAME":"-","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"\"JESUITS\"; \"MAIDS\"","HUM TGT: TYPE":"CIVILIAN: \"MAIDS\"; CIVILIAN: \"JESUITS\"","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"PLURAL: \"JESUITS\"; PLURAL: \"MAIDS\"","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"DEATH: \"MAIDS\"; DEATH: \"JESUITS\"","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.039481Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T17:52:17.766963Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42222,"annotations":[{"id":2161,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-19T01:42:50.297110Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T01:42:50.297143Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.533,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42222,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":2408,"completed_by":8,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-20T16:31:53.369840Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T16:31:53.369875Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.844,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42222,"project":14,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":2478,"completed_by":11,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-20T17:11:23.944894Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T17:11:23.944928Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.758,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42222,"project":14,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":2511,"completed_by":9,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-20T19:29:28.253145Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T19:29:28.253187Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.068,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42222,"project":14,"updated_by":9,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7c844e1e-dev-muc3-0001-0100.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   BOGOTA, 12 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] IT WAS REPORTED IN BOGOTA TODAY THAT\nTHE COLOMBIAN ARMY CAPTURED SUSPECTED PERUVIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER JOSE\nCARDENAS GUERRA ON A FARM IN PURIFICACION, IN CENTRAL COLOMBIA.

THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER\nOF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY\nMOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES\nTHE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE\nARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?\n\n   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING\nSCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE\nATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS\nPRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON\nJIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES\nOF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM\nIS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME\nGUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF\nOUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED\nAND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON\nIN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.\nWE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,\nWHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE\nOURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE\nINTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL\nRIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE\nWE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL\nELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE\nINFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY\nINDEPENDENT.\n\n   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY\nSECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING\nVIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING\nEXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US\nTO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\nATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN\nONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN\nCOUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS\nTHE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED\nEXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT\nTHIS STAGE...\n\n   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.\n\n   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT\nTHE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF\nDEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT\nTHAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST\nDO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.\n\n   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH\nMUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH\nINITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS\nWITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT\nABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO\nPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,\nBECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR\nGOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.\n\n   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT\nGOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS\nRELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT\nAT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.\nWHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'\nDEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC\nEMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS\nSHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE\nMEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?\n\n   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO\nINVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A\nROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT\nWAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH\nPENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK\nABOUT THIS?\n\n   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN\nMAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS\nBEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE\nBECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN\nTHE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS\nHAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE\nLOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT\nEVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS\nDRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL\nTHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY\nTHE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE\nFOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE\nAUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL\nBY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION\nALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE\nREVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON\nCUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?\n\n   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD\nONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS\nATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ\nMARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO\nTHE CRIME PROBLEM.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE\nCOUNTRY.\n\n   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE\nAUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT\nIS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE\nALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?\n\n   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0045 (NCCOSC)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"1","INCIDENT: DATE":"- 26 JAN 89","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"HONDURAS","INCIDENT: TYPE":"ATTACK","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"ACCOMPLISHED","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"-","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"-","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"TERRORIST ACT","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"\"PROFESSIONALS\"","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"-","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"-","PHYS TGT: ID":"-","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"-","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"-","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"-","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-","HUM TGT: NAME":"\"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"\"[RETIRED] GENERAL\": \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"","HUM TGT: TYPE":"FORMER ACTIVE MILITARY: \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"1: \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"DEATH: \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.041337Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.041354Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42244,"annotations":[{"id":1796,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":386,"end":404,"text":"SENTENCED TO DEATH","labels":["trigger"]},"id":"6Rppr8lsDq","from_name":"tag","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-09T20:34:27.063324Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T15:51:37.469319Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1476.384,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42244,"project":14,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":1903,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":386,"end":404,"text":"SENTENCED TO DEATH","labels":["trigger"]},"id":"XHveBFUJSd","from_name":"tag","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":584,"end":600,"text":"WILL BE EXECUTED","labels":["trigger"]},"id":"EIjBt2qM10","from_name":"tag","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-13T18:58:25.462344Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T18:58:25.462378Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":72.35,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42244,"project":14,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":1959,"completed_by":9,"result":[{"value":{"start":386,"end":404,"text":"SENTENCED TO DEATH","labels":["trigger"]},"id":"A2jzGQlznl","from_name":"tag","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-15T14:09:18.010534Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T14:10:24.066067Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":404.76,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42244,"project":14,"updated_by":9,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7c844e1e-dev-muc3-0001-0100.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [COMMUNIQUE] [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION ALLIANCE\n(AAA)] [TEXT] THE ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION ALLIANCE [ALIANZA DE ACCION\nANTICOMUNISTA] REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, IN\nPARTICULAR, AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN GENERAL:\n\n   1.

THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER\nATTACK, LIKE THE ONES WE ARE USED TO, BUT AN ATTACK THAT SIGNALS A NEW\nPOLITICAL ERA SIMILAR TO THOSE WHEN AN ELECTORAL MASSACRE OCCURRED, WHEN\nMSGR ARNULFO ROMERO WAS MURDERED, WHEN OTHER CRIMES MARKED NEW STEPS IN THE\nNEW FASCIST ESCALATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOW LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI,\nCOLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND THE GREAT EXECUTIONER AND PERPETRATOR OF\nMASSACRES, ELENA FUENTES.  THE MAIN THING IS THAT THE FASCIST MILITARY\nDICTATORSHIP, HEADED BY A SMALL ARMED FORCES GROUP, HAS BEEN EXPOSED.  WE\nDO NOT THINK THIS CAN BE IGNORED.  THE STATE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAVE\nTO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE.  THIS PRICE IS COL PONCE'S RESIGNATION, WHICH IS\nNOW DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] AFTER THE ATTACK, INSTEAD OF SEEKING A DETENTE, THE ARMY, ON\nTHE CONTRARY, CONTINUED ITS PROVOCATIONS.  FOR INSTANCE, SEVERAL\nPLAINCLOTHES MEMBERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nFENASTRAS AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT TOOK THEM PRISONER.  MORE THAN 30 OF\nTHEM WERE DETAINED.  WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE POLICE RELEASED A\nCOMMUNIQUE SAYING THEY WOULD STATION ANTIRIOT POLICEMEN AT THE NATIONAL\nCEMETERY.  WE ALSO HEARD COL MAURICIO VARGAS SAYING THAT, IF THE DIALOGUE\nDOOR IS CLOSED, IT HAS TO BE KICKED OPEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE\nSITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS?\n\n   WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY\nBRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION\nOF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION\nWITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.  WE THINK THIS INDICATES [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nBEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.  IT IS A\nMINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR\nMOVEMENT.  THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE\nPROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT\nTHE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT.\n\n   [REPORTER] WITH LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE\nARENA [NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE?  WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE?\n\n   [SANCHO] I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND\nTHE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,\nAS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES.\nTHE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH\nTO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE\nOPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY\nTAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE\nSURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION.  THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE\nRIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING\nGREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.\n\n   [REPORTER] THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT\nIN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD\nIN THIS STRUGGLE.  WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT,\nESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS?\n\n   [SANCHO] ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO\nFENASTRAS.  I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST\nCONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE\nCREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY,\nTHEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL\nGRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT.  FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS\nSAY--ON THE WARPATH.  IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE\nELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN\nTHE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH.  THE COST IS POLITICAL.  IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT\nTHIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION.  THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS\nBEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN\nINTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nAND TO ACHIEVE OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM.

AT 2300 ON 23 [AS HEARD] MAY, NEAR CAYARA, VICTOR FAJARDO\nPROVINCE, AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 100\nSUBVERSIVES AMBUSHED A TWO-VEHICLE ARMY PATROL ON A RELIEF OPERATION\nBETWEEN THE TOWNS OF SAN PEDRO DE GUAILLAS AND HUANCAPI.\n\n   2. THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS OF THE PERUVIAN ARMY DIED AS A RESULT OF\nTHIS CRIMINAL ATTACK: CAPTAIN JOSE URBULU SIMO, SECOND SERGEANT ANGEL\nVARGAS SAMARA, AND CORPORALS FAVIAN ROLDAN ORTIZ AND CARLOS ESPINOZA\nDE LA CRUZ.  FIFTEEN ARMY PERSONNEL WERE ALSO WOUNDED DURING THE\nATTACK, FOUR OF THEM SERIOUSLY.

THEY WILL\nTAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM\nSANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK.\n\n   IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND\nWILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL\nMEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.\n\n   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON\nIMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL\nTELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE\nLACED CYANIDE.

THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE\nDEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO\nTHE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF\nSAMPLES TAKEN.  THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT\nIT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

I MAKE THIS REPORT 50 DAYS AFTER ASSUMING POWER.  AT THIS\nTIME I WANT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH; I WANT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT OUR\nSITUATION IS SO THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MUST DO IN THE\nFUTURE.  EVERY SALVADORAN MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND EFFORT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE A BIT MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE\nNOTHING OR VERY LITTLE.\n\n   THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, BUT WE MUST CONFRONT IT.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE\nA GOVERNMENT:  TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLY,\nBECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOING NOTHING WOULD MEAN A GREATER CRISIS FOR THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WOULD SINK OUR HOMELAND EVEN DEEPER IN THE BLACK ABYSS.\n\n   WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS; WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT GROUPS\nASKING THAT THE GOVERNMENT STATE WHAT IT IS PLANNING TO DO TO SOLVE THE\nPROBLEMS.  I WOULD LIKE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WE PREFER TO ACT CALMLY,\nSTUDY THE PROBLEM IN DEPTH, AND FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL TRULY SOLVE THE\nPROBLEM.  WE WOULD RATHER DO THIS THAN MAKE A RASH DECISION AND MAKE A\nMISTAKE.  THIS IS A TRULY DIFFICULT TASK.\n\n   BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE\nCOUNTRY, I WISH TO TOUCH ON THE THREE MAJOR AREAS THAT CREATE CONCERN AND\nTHAT I FEEL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.  \n\n   FIRST, LET US TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT WAS SWORN AND\nINDISCRIMINATE MURDERS.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE WE\nEXPRESSED OUR RESOLVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO\nTHE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN'S RESPONSE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN MORE VIOLENCE.\n\n   WE KNOW MANY GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY; THEY HAVE\nEVERY REASON TO COMPLAIN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO DO ALL THEY CAN\nTO PROTECT EVERYONE.  THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN THE PAST DAYS, ESPECIALLY\nIN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STRONGER.  THE ARMED\nFORCES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED MANY TIMES AND BY MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE\nGROUPS THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHARE THE FMLN'S IDEAS.  THEY CLAIM THAT\nTHE ARMED FORCES ACT IN A REPRESSIVE MANNER.  DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, LET US\nANALYZE WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES' DUTY IS TO CONTROL ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE\nLAW IS BROKEN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC\nORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES ONLY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ONLY\nCREATE VIOLENCE AND DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT TAKE\nACTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION.  WE HAVE AN ARMED FORCES TO\nDEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NEVER TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\nTHEREFORE, WHAT WE MUST DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REFUSING TO MAKE A\nCOMMITMENT AND WHO IS REFUSING TO SIT DOWN, IN A RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL\nMANNER, TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT THAT NO LONGER HAS A PLACE IN\nOUR HISTORY.  THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT WHAT WE, AS A GOVERNMENT,\nSAID ON 1 JUNE.  ON THAT DAY WE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND\nTALK.  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS A BIT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN\nMISUNDERSTANDINGS OVER OUR INTENTIONS IN THIS DIALOGUE.

WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE VERY\nSHORT TERM, WE HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS\nWITH AT LEAST THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES FOR THE PEOPLE.  WE\nHAVE ALLOTTED 17 MILLION COLONS FOR THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR THE\nPURCHASE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND FOR THE\nDISTRIBUTION OF THIS MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THAT THE POOR\nWILL RECEIVE THE EFFICIENT HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST\nPROVIDE.\n\n   THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS BEEN ASKED TO GIVE STUDENTS THE MATERIALS THEY\nNEED TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES.  A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOTTED\nFOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED BY THE SCHOOLS.  WHEN THE 1990 SCHOOL\nYEAR BEGINS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH\nTHE MATERIAL THEY NEED.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN, AS\nSOON AS POSSIBLE, REPAIRING THE STREETS AND ROADS.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\nCAN SEE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE.\n\n   FINALLY, LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  NEXT WEEK THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER WILL\nANNOUNCE THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE WILL HELP\nLOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY HOMES.  THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH A SUBSIDY PLAN\nENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME GROUPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY STEEP PAYMENTS AND\nWILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES.\n\n   WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED A SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN.  THIS PLAN WILL BE\nIMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND ITS FIRST PHASE WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE\nHIGHLY POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE PLAN WILL BENEFIT APPROXIMATELY 200\nCOMMUNITIES AND, AS OF NOW, I ASK THE MAYORS FOR THEIR HELP, BECAUSE WE WANT\nTO WORK WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  THIS FIRST PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT\nPROVIDING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES.  WE WILL PROVIDE\nTHEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER, WE WILL BUILD SEWER SYSTEMS, AND WE\nWILL HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  AMID THE CRISIS WE ARE\nEXPERIENCING, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE SMALL - SCALE\nBUSINESSMEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES.  WE WILL ORGANIZE A LOAN SYSTEM FOR SMALL\n- SIZE BUSINESSES FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.  I REPEAT:  THIS\nSOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER.  IN THE NEXT FEW\nWEEKS, WE WILL BEGIN TO SEEK THE COOPERATION OF THOSE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS\nTHAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN.\n\n   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE MUST ALL STRUGGLE FOR, AND THAT IS TO\nABOLISH UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE MUST STRUGGLE SO THAT EVERY SALVADORAN WILL HAVE\nTHE CHANCE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.  WE THEREFORE WISH TO LAUNCH AN\nOFFENSIVE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT\nVIOLENCE IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT\nFIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST COMMIT\nCRIMES TO SURVIVE OR THAT THEY MUST GET INVOLVED IN THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE\nSPONSORED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  THEREFORE, IN SEPTEMBER, WE WILL ALSO\nIMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT.  THIS PLAN HAS SOME\nSPECIFIC GOALS:  FIRST, TO PROVIDE A BASIC JOB FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE\nUNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED.  OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE 20,000 JOBS PER MONTH\nFOR THESE PEOPLE.  THIS PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AND WE\nWILL IMPLEMENT IT DURING THOSE MONTHS WHEN THERE IS USUALLY A DROP IN\nEMPLOYMENT.  I MUST STRESS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN\nDURING THE SOWING AND HARVEST SEASONS, BECAUSE DURING THOSE SEASONS THERE IS\nAN OVERABUNDANCE OF JOBS.

THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A\nBIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL\nARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES,\nCONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC.  HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN\nDEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT.\n\n   OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST?  WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION.  THIS\nREPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.  SINCE\nARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6\nBILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND\nTO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC.\n\n   OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN\nINTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS.\n\n   THIS IS NOT NEW.  THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN\nTHE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO.  WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME\nECONOMY MINISTER [MARCH 1976], THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION.\nWHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION.  THE\nMILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND\nINCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN.\nALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION.\nSO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION.\n\n   THIS IS NOT ALL.  WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD.  WE HAVE NOT\nEVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR.  WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN\nPAYMENTS.  THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR\nDEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW.  WE ARE NOT PAYING\nANYTHING.\n\n   FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS\nTHE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK.\n\n   ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING.  COUNTRIES ARE\nINTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST\nCATEGORIES.  OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED.  COMMERCIAL\nCREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY\nNEEDS.\n\n   WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL\nBANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED.  THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A\nCRISIS AT ANY MOMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS.\n\n   THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE\nEXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY\nCHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING.  BUT WE\nCANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS.  WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.\n\n   OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  OUR COUNTRY HAS NO\nPRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY.  NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR\nABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE\nNOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS.  EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF\nINTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT.  THERE HAVE\nBEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH.\n\n   WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE?  THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN\nHIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY.  HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT\nTHAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR.  HE USED\nWORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST.  \n\n   IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST\nOF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS\nOWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT.  WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF\nTHE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE,\nFLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS.\n\n   IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nPAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE.  WE WOULD BE\nISOLATED.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nOBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nINTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND\nPROGRESSING.  WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY.  THEREFORE\nTHERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING.  THE HONOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY IS AT STAKE.\n\n   WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY?  YOU KNOW\nTHAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY.  WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY,\nFISHING, MINING, ETC.  WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES.  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN\nARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.\nWE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS\nWITH OUR NEIGHBORS.\n\n   WHAT ARE WE MISSING?  WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE?\nWE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER.  WE LIVE\nIN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER.  SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL\nIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\n\n   I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE\nTAPPED.  FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE\nALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY.  JUST\nREMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY.  TO PROTECT THEMSELVES\nFROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO?  THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD\nOR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES.  WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE\nMATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO\nHAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD.  ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL,\nMEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY.  A\nPERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS\nMATTRESS.  MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST,\nDOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS\nNOR THE COUNTRY.\n\n   SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY,\nBECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND.  WE ARE NOT\nBANKRUPT.  WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING.  THE\nSECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT.  ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN\nBE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED.  NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED\nIT INTO A RESOLUTION.  INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN,\nDEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY.  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE\nWITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS\nWERE DEPOSITED.  NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM.  THIS WILL BE\nREINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC\nPOWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL\nSYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE\nBENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR.  ANYBODY WHO HAS\n$10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE\nGUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nDISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME.  THE BANK WILL\nLEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.\nNEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER\nWILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE\nTHEIR WITHDRAWAL.  THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE\nIS IMPOSSIBLE.  EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS.  IT HAS\nA CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT\nMOVES THE COUNTRY.  MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO\nTHIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO\nBRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE\nBECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION.\n\n   IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE\nCOUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT\nTHE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT.  ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON\nCONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP.  THIS\nIS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT.  TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE\nADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.  THESE\nMEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY\nRECOVER.  WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE\nLIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0313 (ITP, NYU)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"*","INCIDENT: DATE":"*","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"*","INCIDENT: TYPE":"*","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"*","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"*","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"*","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"*","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"*","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"*","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"*","PHYS TGT: ID":"*","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"*","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"*","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"*","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"*","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"*","HUM TGT: NAME":"*","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"*","HUM TGT: TYPE":"*","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"*","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"*","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"*","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"*"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.088618Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.088635Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42613,"annotations":[{"id":2619,"completed_by":8,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-21T15:47:46.012043Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T15:47:46.012077Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.808,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42613,"project":14,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"db3b339b-dev-muc3-0301-0400.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   LIMA, 28 JUL 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN\nPRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPTS] MR PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, GENTLEMEN\nMEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS:\n\n   TEN YEARS AGO, THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY PRESIDED OVER BY\nHAYA DE LA TORRE, CALLING UP ON LORD GOD FOR STRENGTH AND IN KEEPING WITH\nTHE POWERS VESTED IN US BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, APPROVED THE\nNATIONAL CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BEING COMES FIRST AND THAT\nALL HONORABLE PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSALLY VALID RIGHTS.  THUS WE DECIDED TO WORK\nFOR A FREE AND JUST SOCIETY AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE\nBASED ON POPULAR WILL AND ON THE FREE, PERIODIC CONSULTATION OF THIS WILL.\n\n   WE BET ON CIVILIZED COEXISTENCE AS A WAY OF LAUNCHING A PROCESS BASED ON\nSTABLE AND LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS, HOWEVER,\nWERE SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 1, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL'S BASIC RIGHTS\nAND DUTIES FOR THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS PERSONALITY.\n\n   OUR CONSTITUTION WAS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE ACHIEVED AMONG VARIOUS AND\nSOMETIMES ANTAGONISTIC POLITICAL FORCES.  THUS, SOME OF ITS ECONOMIC\nARTICLES MAY SEEM VAGUE. HOWEVER, UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION ANY IDEOLOGY CAN\nGOVERN THE COUNTRY AND MAKE CHANGES IN ANY DIRECTION WHATSOEVER, AS LONG AS\nTHOSE FIRST CONDITIONS AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS ARE RESPECTED. [PASSAGE\nOMITTED]\n\n   THIS IS THE LAST MESSAGE I WILL DELIVER TO CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT BEFORE I\nTURN THE PRESIDENCY OVER TO A CITIZEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.\n\n   I CANNOT FAIL TO EXPAND ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE THIS YEAR, WHICH,\nHONESTLY SPEAKING ARE MUCH FEWER THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. I AM DELIVERING A\nSUMMARY OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING, AS ESTABLISH BY THE CONSTITUTION,\nFOR THE USE OF THE LEGISLATORS. IT IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENTS.\n\n   IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO SAY THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE\nGOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE TO REAFFIRM THE SYSTEM OF\nDEMOCRATIC FREEDOM, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM PERU HAS. WITH THIS\nFREEDOM, EVEN THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS CAN EXIST. THE REACTIONARY\nPOSITIONS OF THE ULTRARIGHT AND RADICAL IDEOLOGIES CAN ALSO LIVE IN FREEDOM.\nVIOLENCE HAS LESS CHANCE OF DEVELOPING IN FREEDOM.  THE NATION HAS MORE\nLEGITIMATE MEANS TO ERADICATE VIOLENCE UNDER FREEDOM.\n\n   LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES DISAGREEMENTS,\nPOLITICAL PARTIES, LAWS, AND SKILLFUL LEGAL PROCEDURES CAN OBSTRUCT MANY\nTHINGS AND STOP DECISIONS. BUT THIS IS THE PRICE FOR A CIVILIZED LIFESTYLE.\nDEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE THE FORTHRIGHTNESS OF A DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY IS\nSLOWER, BUT DEMANDS MORE FIRMNESS, MORE CONVICTION, MORE PATIENCE. DEMOCRACY\nDEMANDS THE GRADUAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE; THIS TAKES A LONG TIME. I AM\nSAYING THIS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC\nCRISIS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1988, AND IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MAKE HARSH CHANGES\nAT A TIME WHEN VIOLENCE HAS SEEMED TO INCREASE.\n\n   WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST THEIR COOL DEMANDING AN INTERRUPTION OF\nOUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CALLED FOR A SHORTER GOVERNMENT TERM. THEY ALSO SAID\nTHAT THE COUNTRY COULD DEFEAT THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS\nBY RESTRICTING FREEDOM AND ESTABLISHING AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE IMMATURE VOICES, DECEITFUL TEMPTATIONS. MANY OF\nTHOSE VOICES UNFORTUNATELY CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH. BY DOING\nTHIS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT YET READY TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY\nAND TO ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TENSIONS, EVEN AT THE WORSE TIMES,\nSHOULD BE HANDLED WITH SERENITY AND PATIENCE. A DICTATORSHIP THAT VIOLATES\nLEGAL PROCEDURES WILL ONLY HELP TO INCREASE VIOLENCE AND LEGITIMATE\nINSURGENCY, AND WOULD STIMULATE THE CREATION OF NEW SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. A\nDICTATORSHIP CANNOT SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED\nPOWER AND WOULD IMPOSE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE.\n\n   I AM REFERRING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE A CRUCIAL\nPERIOD. I CALL ON THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY\nBY REALIZING THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH MORE\nDEMOCRACY, WITH MORE FREEDOM, AND WITH MORE PARTICIPATION. TO HAVE\nDEMOCRACY, ONE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE.\n\n   THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. I AM COMMITTED TO MORE FREEDOM AND\nMORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH SOMETIMES WE DOUBT BECAUSE OF EXCESSES.\nBUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, BECAUSE WITHOUT FREEDOM\nOF EXPRESSION ABUSE WILL PREVAIL.

THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT\nTHE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND\nITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ.  CUSTODIO SAID THIS\nDURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CUSTODIO] WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE\nHERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE\nOF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.\n\n   FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY\nAT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO\nGARAY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS\nSO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW\nCALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO\nTESTIFY.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED\nSALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.\n\n   LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE\nBRUTALITY.  THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS\nASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP [PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES] AGENT WHO IS NOW\nSERVING A PRISON SENTENCE.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL\nMENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO.  DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN\nWAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI [DEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL INVESTIGATION] AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500.  HE WAS NOT\nALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN\nISOLATION.  HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN.  NO ONE\nEXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END.  HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD\nREPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE.  THIS MEANS\nTHAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS\nTHE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF\nHONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] ILLEGALLY ABUSE\nTHEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS\nSHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC\nRELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COL SUAREZ] I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON\nCUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED\nHIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR.  WE THOUGHT HE ONLY\nHANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY.\nHOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE.\n\n   I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT\nBATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE\nUNIT NO LONGER EXISTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE\nMAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS.  THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER,\nWHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY\nCARRIED OUT.  IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS\nTO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS.  THAT IS\nALL.  I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN\nHIS STATEMENTS.

THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT\nTHE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND\nITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ.  CUSTODIO SAID THIS\nDURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CUSTODIO] WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE\nHERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE\nOF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.\n\n   FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY\nAT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO\nGARAY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS\nSO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW\nCALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO\nTESTIFY.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED\nSALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.\n\n   LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE\nBRUTALITY.  THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS\nASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP [PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES] AGENT WHO IS NOW\nSERVING A PRISON SENTENCE.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL\nMENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO.  DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN\nWAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI [DEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL INVESTIGATION] AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500.  HE WAS NOT\nALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN\nISOLATION.  HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN.  NO ONE\nEXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END.  HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD\nREPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE.  THIS MEANS\nTHAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS\nTHE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF\nHONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] ILLEGALLY ABUSE\nTHEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS\nSHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC\nRELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COL SUAREZ] I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON\nCUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED\nHIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR.  WE THOUGHT HE ONLY\nHANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY.\nHOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE.\n\n   I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT\nBATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE\nUNIT NO LONGER EXISTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE\nMAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS.  THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER,\nWHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY\nCARRIED OUT.  IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS\nTO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS.  THAT IS\nALL.  I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN\nHIS STATEMENTS.  I SOMETIMES BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ON ONE SIDE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE MIND.\n\n   [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHEN WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE ABLE TO GIVE THE\nHONDURAN PEOPLE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE LATEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nREPORTED MISSING IN OUR COUNTRY?\n\n   [COL SUAREZ] EXCUSE ME, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU.\n\n   [REPORTER] I ASKED: WHEN CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE HAVE EXACT\nINFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN THE\nCOUNTRY?\n\n   [COL SUAREZ] LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHORTLY, AND I AM\nTALKING ABOUT A SHORT TIME, HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE HONDURAN\nPEOPLE ON THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS\nCONTINUE.

WE CENTRAL\nAMERICANS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEING KILLED, NOT THE U.S.  SOLDIERS.\nTHE UNITED STATES HAS THE DUTY TO RESPECT DECISIONS MADE BY THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE THE REAL BASES OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE\nNICARAGUAN OPPOSITION?\n\n   [ORTEGA] IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BY ALL POLITICAL PARTIES.\nOBVIOUSLY, I SIGNED IT MYSELF.  THE MAIN POINT IN THE DOCUMENT IS THAT WE\nPROPOSE THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS.  THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE WE\nDISCUSSED.  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT ONCE THE CONTRAS ARE DISMANTLED, THERE\nWILL BE AN AMNESTY, AND PRISONERS REMAINING IN NICARAGUA WILL BE RELEASED.\nWE ALSO STRESSED THAT FOREIGN FORCES SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN THE NICARAGUAN\nELECTION PROCESS; THE CIA, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MEDDLE IN THE\nNICARAGUAN ELECTION PROCESS; THIS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE U.S.  CONGRESS.\nTHEREFORE, WE ARE AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, WHICH SHOWS DISRESPECT FOR\nNICARAGUAN SOVEREIGNTY.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] CONCERNING [WORDS INDISTINCT].\nHOWEVER, IS IT NOT ALSO NECESSARY TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS?\n\n   [ORTEGA] WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED\nSTATES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO STAY IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES PROMOTED THE CONTRAS.  THE UNITED\nSTATES SHOULD NOT PLACE THIS BURDEN ON HONDURAS OR ON THE OTHER\nCENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THEREFORE, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS\nWITH THE CONTRAS TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE, TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE IN\nAN ORDERLY MANNER AND NOT BY SHOOTING AT THEM.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THE CONTRAS ARE DEMANDING GUARANTEES.  \n\n   [ORTEGA] GUARANTEES ALREADY EXIST IN NICARAGUA.  \n\n   [REPORTER] COMMANDER ORTEGA, DO YOU HELP THE FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] WHAT?  \n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] WE ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SAID IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT NICARAGUA\nPROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN.  THIS WAS SAID YESTERDAY BY\nNICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO.\n\n   [ANNOUNCER] THE STATEMENTS BY COMMANDER DANIEL ORTEGA HAVE BEEN\nINTERRUPTED BECAUSE THE PLANE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO\nTAKE OFF FROM THE TELA AIRPORT.  AT THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER\nIS ASKING MR ORTEGA TO GO TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS\nTRYING TO CONVINCE ORTEGA TO STOP MAKING STATEMENTS, BUT MR ORTEGA SEEMS\nVERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  AT THIS MOMENT,\nPRESIDENT ORTEGA CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BEING POSED BY LOCAL AND\nFOREIGN NEWSMEN BECAUSE THE PLANE IS TAKING OFF.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR ORTEGA...  \n\n   [ORTEGA] INTERRUPTING CONCERNING YOUR QUESTION A FEW MINUTES AGO\nREGARDING THE FMLN.  I JUST HELD A MEETING; I JUST HELD A MEETING WITH\nTHE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  THEY ARE TOURING THE AREA, AND I HAVE MET\nTHEM.  THEY GAVE ME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS EXPRESSING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, USING AS A BASIS THE DIALOGUE THAT THE FMLN HAS\nHELD WITH THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FLMN\nRECENTLY MET WITH THE LEGALLY REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES IN EL\nSALVADOR.

THROUGHOUT HISTORY,\nTHE NATIONAL ARMY HAS COMPLIED WITH THAT MANDATE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN AN\nEASY TASK, EVEN LESS SO DURING THE TIMES WE ARE LIVING.  VERY FEW\nNATIONS HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT SIMULTANEOUSLY SO MANY DIFFICULT\nCHALLENGES.  CONFRONTED BY A COMBINATION OF SOURCES OF DISRUPTION, THE\nARMED FORCES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR DETERMIANTION AND OPTIMISM, NOR HAVE\nTHEY STOPPED FOR 1 MINUTE TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF\nTRANQUILLITY FOR THE CITIZENS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE, HONOR,\nAND PROPERTY OF COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS THE VIOLENCE INCREASES, OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND COLOMBIA IS\nSTRENGTHENED.  THE PRICE OF COURAGE AND FIRMNESS HAS BEEN HIGH.  MANY\nSOLDIERS, OFFICERS, AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THEY\nARE THE HEROES OF DEMOCRACY.  ON THE OCCASION OF ARMY DAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF\nOF THE VAST NATIONAL MAJORITY AND CONVEY TO THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND\nFELLOW SOLDIERS OUR MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, APPRECIATION, AND HOPE.  THEIR\nEFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN IN VAIN.\n\n   THE BATTLE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND DEFEAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES.  THE\nDETERMINATION OF COLOMBIANS DOES NOT WEAKEN.  OUR ENEMIES ARE ALONE, AS\nNEVER BEFORE, AND THIS WE OWE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS BY OUR ARMED FORCES.\n\n   IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, I OFFERED THE COLOMBIANS A POLICY OF\nRECONCILIATION BASED ON DEFINED GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES.  THIS WAS\nTHE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE.  NOW, WHEN WE ARE\nHARVESTING THE RESULTS OF THAT STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT GIVE UP.  THE PEACE\nINITIATIVE HAS SHOWED THAT IT CAN OPERATE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE\nFRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT POLITICAL ACTION FOR NATIONAL\nRECONCILIATION.\n\n   SOME BELIEVE THAT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEAVE IT\nIDLE, AT THE MERCY OF VIOLENCE.  OTHERS ARGUE THAT PEACE CAN ONLY BE\nACHIEVED IF WE DISMANTLE OUR CAPABILITY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  WE DO NOT\nAGREE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONFIRMED THAT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE\nQUEST FOR PEACE ARE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE\nARMED FORCES, BUT THAT THIS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ADVANCING THE POLITICAL\nHANDLING OF VIOLENCE.\n\n   EFFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT SERVE THE COUNTRY ARE A\nDEFINITE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.\nTHAT IS WHY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A GREAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL\nEFFORT TO RETURN TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTIONS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ACTION.\n\n   THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IS A\nSUITABLE TIME TO PONDER OUR DUTY TO THE HOMELAND.  I AM NOT REFERRING TO\nDAILY CIVIC DUTIES, WHICH ARE PROPER TO ALL OF US COLOMBIANS, BUT TO\nSOMETHING MUCH DEEPER -- LOYALTY TO DEMOCRACY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS.\nDEMOCRACY'S BOUNDARIES ARE BROAD, BUT PRECISE.  WHEN VIOLENCE TO A CERTAIN\nEXTENT IS TOLERATED, MORE VIOLENCE IS CREATED, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST\nPEACE, AND CONFLICTS ARE AGGRAVATED.  THE ENTIRE SOCIETY HAS SUFFERED\nBECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENEMIES OF COLOMBIA.

[APPLAUSE] THIS\nCEREMONY, IN WHICH WE HONOR THE HEROES OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ARMY, IS A\nSUITABLE OCCASION TO MAKE KNOWN TO OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND\nSOLDIERS ALIKE THE NATION'S RECOGNITION OF THEIR COURAGEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL\nFULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES.  WHEN THE ARMED FORCES ACADEMIES PARADE BEFORE\nUS, SO WILL THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SERVING\nTHE HOMELAND AND THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.  EVERY HONEST COLOMBIAN SUPPORTS\nTHEM.\n\n   SOLDIERS: YOU, WHO WIELD THE NATION'S ARMS, REPRESENT THE BASIC GUARANTEE\nTHAT PRESERVES SOVEREIGNTY, LIBERTY, AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.

THIS MEANS THAT ALL 18- TO\n50-YEAR-OLD PERUVIANS ARE OF MILITARY AGE, AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO\nCOMPLY WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW, IN THE RESERVE.\n\n   THEREFORE, ONE NOT ONLY COMPLIES WITH THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN ONE\nIS ASSIGNED ON ACTIVE DUTY TO A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS, BUT ONE\nCONTINUES COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW BY REMAINING IN THE RESERVE UNTIL 50 YEARS\nOF AGE.\n\n   ARTICLE 272 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES:  MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS\nOF AGE AND WOMEN BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE NOT ON ACTIVE\nMILITARY SERVICE ALL BELONG TO THE RESERVE, AND THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE\nOBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY CLAUSE 4 OF THIS LAW.\n\n   IF THE LAW STATES THIS, I THEN ASK ALL PERUVIANS: ARE NOT TERRORISTS --\nWHO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES RESERVES AND WHO TAKE ARMS TO ATTACK THE\nNATIONAL POLICE AND ARMED FORCES -- VIOLATING THE OBLIGATORY MILITARY\nSERVICE LAW?  IS NOT HE, WHO BY VIOLENT MEANS TRIES TO DESTROY THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF WHICH THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART, VIOLATING THE\nMILITARY SERVICE LAW?\n\n   THEREFORE, SINCE ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT THOSE WHO\nVIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW CAN BE TRIED BY THE MILITARY\nCODE OF JUSTICE, THEN TERRORISTS CAN BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS.\n\n   THUS THE IDEA IS THAT ONE LAW, ONE ARTICLE, SHOULD ESTABLISH THAT THE\nCRIME OF TERRORISM VIOLATES THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW, THEREFORE ENABLING A\nQUICK AND DRASTIC PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS.  \n\n   IT WILL THEREFORE NOT BE NECESSARY TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  A CORRECT\nINTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ALL THAT WILL BE NEEDED.  WE MUST ALSO\nREMEMBER THAT WHEN THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION WAS APPROVED THERE WAS NO\nSERIOUS TERRORIST PROBLEM.  BESIDES, YOU MUST KNOW THAT TO AMMEND THE\nCONSTITUTION WE MUST WAIT NEARLY 2 YEARS, AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.\n\n   MANY PERUVIANS THINK THAT IF MILITARY COURTS TRY TERRORISTS THEY WILL BE\nSENTENCED TO DEATH.  THIS IS FALSE, IT IS NOT CORRECT.  THE MILITARY COURTS\nWILL ONLY RULE SENTENCES IN KEEPING WITH THE LAW, BUT THESE SENTENCES WILL\nBE APPLIED FIRMLY.  THIS MEANS THAT CRIMINALS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED.\n\n   I ASK ALL PERUVIANS AND ALL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL.\nTERRORISTS MUST NOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DO NOT\nTRUST THE CIVILIAN COURTS.  THIS MEANS THAT WE MUST SIMPLY INTERPRET THE\nCONSTITUTION APPROPRIATELY.  TERRORISTS REALLY DO VIOLATE THEIR CONDITION AS\nARMED FORCES RESERVES WHEN THEY TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE\nARMED FORCES.\n\n   IT IS THEREFORE OUR PURPOSE TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY.  THE CONSTITUTION\nMUST BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF PERU, SINCE IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED IN\nFAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.  \n\n   I AM SURPRISED THAT ON THE ONE SIDE PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LITTLE ACTION\n TAKEN AGAINST TERRORISTS, WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A CONCRETE\nINITIATIVE LIKE THIS ONE TO PUNISH THEM.\n\n   THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RESUME THE DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE THE\nELECTION CAMPAIGNS MAKE US FORGET THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  ON\nTHE CONTRARY, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS WE MUST QUICKLY MAKE ALL\nTHE IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND APPROVE STRICT PUNISHMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO\nLIVE IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, PEACE, AND SAFETY.

THE OVERALL PICTURE HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN THE\nLAST FEW YEARS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THAT CHANGE, MAJOR?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] IN PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE NOTES THEY [THE FMLN\nCOMMANDERS] HAVE SENT, INCLUDING THE ONES SENT PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS,\nTHEY SAID THAT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE POSTPONED THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE.\nTHAT IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY DO HAVE PLANS TO JOIN THE PROCESS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MAJOR?   \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] IT MEANS TWO BASIC THINGS:  ONE, THEY ARE LOST.  THE OPTION\nTO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS NO LONGER EXISTS.  \n\n   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE LOST IN THE MILITARY FIELD?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] THEY ARE LOST BOTH IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND IN\nTHE OPTION TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  SECOND, THEY NO LONGER\nHAVE THE SUPPORT, AND WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW.  THERE\nIS NO LONGER ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS TYPE OF REBEL MOVEMENT, FOR THIS TYPE OF\nARMED REBEL MOVEMENT TO SEIZE POWER.\n\n   [REPORTER] YOU MEAN SUPPORT FROM THE USSR?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] THERE IS NO SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNIST WORLD IN\nGENERAL.  NATURALLY, THIS IS BASED VERY MUCH ON THE SO-CALLED PERESTROYKA.\nTHEREFORE, THEY WILL HAVE TO JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE\nTHEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT.  IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE SHOOTING BULLETS\nJUST FOR THE SAKE OF SHOOTING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING\nAND EVERYONE.\n\n   [REPORTER] THERE IS MUCH TALK HERE ABOUT FORMING AN INTERNAL OPPOSITION\nFRONT; I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE \"EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA\" CAMPAIGN.  DO\nYOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS AND THE LINE THIS INTERNAL FRONT MIGHT\nFOLLOW?\n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, NOT EXACTLY.  HOWEVER, IT IS LOGICAL THAT AN INTERNAL\nPOLITICAL FRONT COULD BE FORMED.  THAT WOULD BE A POLITICAL PROCESS WITHIN A\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  IT IS ALL RIGHT TO DO THAT.  THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN\nTHE WORLD TO DO THAT.\n\n   NOW, THERE ARE SUBVERSIVE THOUGHTS.  WE ARE REFERRING TO THOSE BIG MANGY\nDOGS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST STEPS IN JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  ON\nTHE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISRUPTING PUBLIC\nORDER.  IF WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CAUSE HARM AND HINDER THE PROGRAMS PREPARED\nBY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS CABINET, THEY ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT\nANYHOW.\n\n   REMEMBER THAT VERY SIMPLE PHRASE I TOLD YOU AT THE BEGINNING.  THEY\nCLAIM THAT IF ARENA FAILS, THEY ARE THE ALTERNATIVE.  THAT IS WHAT THE\nGROUP OF UNGO, ZAMORA, AND ALL THOSE REALLY THINKS.  THERE IS ANOTHER\nGREAT POSSIBILITY, AND THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN HERE:\nARENA WILL NOT FAIL.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL NOT FAIL.  HOWEVER,\nTHEY ARE GOING TO TRY ALL THE ILLEGAL, SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN TO\nMAKE US FAIL.

ALL KINDS OF JURIDICAL VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST US.\n\n   5.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BRIBED JUSTICE WITH [WORDS INDISTINCT], DIPLOMATIC\nSINECURES, AND TRIPS ABROAD.\n\n   6.  THE ACTIONS OF CONFISCATION ARE NOTHING NEW; THEY HAVE ALWAYS\nPREVAILED IN OUR COUNTRY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE UNJUSTLY ARRESTED AND\nIMPRISONED, EVEN THOUGH NO ARREST WARRANTS HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST THEM, AND\nMANY OF OUR PROPERTIES AND POSSESSIONS WERE ARBITRARILY CONFISCATED OR\nUSURPED.\n\n   7.  COLOMBIAN CITIZENS CHARGED WITH MONEY LAUNDERING HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED\nAND WILL BE EXTRADITED, ALTHOUGH THIS REPRESENTS A VIOLATION OF COLOMBIAN\nLAWS.  \n\n   8.  WE ALWAYS WERE, ARE, AND WILL BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE BUT WE\nWILL NOT LOWER OUR GUARD AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR STRUGGLE AND WIDESPREAD\nWAR AGAINST TRAITORS AND TURNCOATS.\n\n   9.  WE DECLARE A WIDESPREAD AND TOTAL WAR ON THE GOVERNMENT, THE\nINDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, THE JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE ATTACKED AND\nMISTREATED US, JUDGES WHO HAVE BEEN BRIBED BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE\nEXTRADITING MAGISTRATES, THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION PRESIDENTS, AND ALL THOSE\nWHO HAVE PERSECUTED US IN THE PAST.\n\n   10.  WE WILL NOT RESPECT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT RESPECTED OUR\nFAMILIES. WE WILL KILL THEM, AND WE WILL BURN AND DESTROY THE OLIGARCHY'S\nINDUSTRIES, PROPERTIES, AND MANSIONS.\n\n   (SIGNED) THE EXTRADITABLES.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0371 (BBN)","MESSAGE:

ALL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF\nTHEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS, IN OTHER WORDS TO THEIR CHIEF ESCORT.  THE\nCHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL\nPROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER.\n\n   THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY\nTHREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES.  THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS\nESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE.\n\n   2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS\nILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES.  THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE\nNAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS.\n\n   3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  HIS\nESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO.\n\n   4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE\nLAST MINUTE.  THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE.  HE MUST CHANGE\nROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT.\n\n   5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP.  \n\n   6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN.  HE WILL HAVE\nTO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST.  SUPPORTERS, PLEASE\nTAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\n\n   7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR\nCANDIDATE.  PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS.\n\n   8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING\nDEMONSTRATIONS.  SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS.\n\n   9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE\nCANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY.  ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW\nSUCH THINGS.\n\n   10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE\nTHEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM.  CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS\nAT UNUSUAL HOURS.\n\n   THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON.  ALL THESE MEASURES\nHAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS.  THEIR SUPPORTERS MUST\nUNDERSTAND THEIR CANDIDATES' SITUATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT PREVENTS\nVIOLENCE, IT IS DOING A MORE PROFESSIONAL JOB THAN IF IT ALLOWED IT TO\nTAKE PLACE, BECAUSE ONCE THE VIOLENCE GETS STARTED, THE CONSEQUENCES\nOF THEIR ACTIONS MAY BE A LOT MORE UNFORTUNATE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE\nPOLICY OF TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENT PLANS BEFORE THEY ARE CARRIED OUT\nIS SOMETHING THAT HAS PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS.\n\n   OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE SUSPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF SUPPORTING THE\nFMLN PLANS ARE ARRESTED AND TURNED OVER TO THE JUDGE ONCE THE EVIDENCE IS\nGATHERED.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.  UNFORTUNATELY MANY\nOF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED ARE LATER RELEASED.  MANY OF THEM TURN OUT TO BE\nINNOCENT BECAUSE SUSPICIONS MAY TURN OUT TO BE FALSE AND THE JUDGE IS THERE\nTO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING COMMITTED.

HOWEVER, HE TOURED THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW OFF\nHIS BURNT KNEE AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN TORTURED HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  IT\nHAD BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS\nRELEASED.  THE LEFT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES\nABROAD.  HOWEVER, I DO NO BELIEVE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.\n\n   [KOBERG] MR PRESIDENT, AN ANALYST WHO MET WITH US A SHORT TIME AGO GAVE\nHIS OPINION ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE AND ITS RESULTS.  HE WAS NOT\nVERY OPTIMISTIC AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL POINTS THAT COULD BECOME\nOBSTACLES TO THE DIALOGUE.  ONE OF THEM WAS THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  HE SAID\nTHAT THE FMLN COULD NOT HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE\nGOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THE ECONOMIC MEASURES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.  WE HAVE\nLEARNED FROM THE FMLN COMMUNIQUES, WHICH ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP\nIMPLEMENTING THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS AND OTHER SERIES OF POINTS\nCONCERNING THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WITHIN THIS\nFRAMEWORK, WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE OR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT\nUNDERSTAND BY NEGOTIATION?  COULD THERE BE POSSIBLE NEGOTIATION ON THE\nECONOMIC POLICY?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HERE IN OUR COUNTRY NO LONGER\nHAS THAT GENERIC MEANING GIVEN BY THE DICTIONARY.  THIS WORD HAS BEEN\nMANIPULATED BY LEFTIST FORCES IN THE SENSE THAT TO NEGOTIATE IS TO ACCEPT\nWHAT THE FMLN WANTS.  ACCORDING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS WHAT NEGOTIATING\nMEANS.  I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HAS A GENERIC MEANING.  A NEGOTIATION\nIS TO TRY TO FIND JOINT AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE\nHAVE BEEN PROPOSING.  WE HAVE SOUGHT AGREEMENTS ON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF\nPOINTS POSSIBLE.  LOGICALLY, NOT ALL POINTS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER\nSIDE AND WE BELIEVE THE FMLN IS MAKING A MISTAKE WHEN IT THINKS IT WILL\nNEGOTIATE ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR SOCIAL PLATFORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\nTHE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR PLANS FOR THE\nCOUNTRY WITH THE PEOPLE.  THAT IS DONE BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND BY SHOWING\nTHEIR PROPOSALS TO THE PUBLIC.  IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR\nPROPOSALS ARE BEST, THEY WILL GET THE VOTES AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO\nIMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS.\n\n   IN THIS CASE, UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE; IT WAS OUR PARTY\nPLATFORM THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.  THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT\nTO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ASK OF THEM.\n\n   WE DO NOT THINK THE FMLN SHOULD OPPOSE THIS OFFERING.  THE FMLN REFUSES\nTO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND KEEPS LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND SETTING\nCONDITIONS, SUCH AS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECLARE ITSELF TEMPORARY\nBEFORE ANY TALKS ARE CONSIDERED.  THEY KNOW THEY ARE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE.\nTHEIR TRUE PURPOSE IS TO REFUSE TO TALK SERIOUSLY, WHICH THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE WANTS THEM TO DO.  LORENA, I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD CONFUSE THE\nVARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED.  HOLDING A DIALOGUE IS NOT EASY, AS POINTED OUT BY\nTHIS ANALYST, WHOSE NAME I DO NOT KNOW.  THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY TO\nRESOLVE.  THIS PROCESS COULD WELL LAST MANY MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS.  IT IS\nNECESSRY TO START NOW WITH A DIALOGUE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES BEGIN TO DISCUSS,\nNOT WHAT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON, BUT WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON.  WE SHOULD BEGIN BY\nTRYING TO ELIMINATE THE VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  IF THEY FIND\nTHEY CANNOT AGREE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD\nALSO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE STANCE.

THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND\nCONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nAND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS\nON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY\nAND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED.  WE RECOGNIZE AND\nENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS\nGIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT\nHINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT.\n\n   3.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS,\nCAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS.  ALSO, THEY\nHAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT\nRESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES'\nDISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR\nACTIONS.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND\nDEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   4.  FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, [PRESIDENT\nALFREDO] CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF\nNEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN.  THIS ATTITUDE BY THE\nARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO\nCIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF\nTHE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT\nBE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL.\n\n   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO\nSTAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nWILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL\nLEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER.

  CLANDESTINE, 27 AUG 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] 1.\nON SUNDAY 20 AUGUST, EIGHT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT] DISABLED WAR COMRADES OCCUPIED THE [SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN]\nCATHEDRAL, WHERE THEY REMAIN STILL TO PROTEST THE VIOLATIONS BY THE\nARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL\nLAW AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE WHEN THE RELEASE\nAND EXCHANGE OF COLONEL [OMAR NAPOLEON] AVALOS WAS NEGOTIATED IN\nPANAMA [IN 1987].\n\n   2.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND\nCONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nAND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS\nON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY\nAND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED.  WE RECOGNIZE AND\nENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS\nGIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT\nHINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT.\n\n   3.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS,\nCAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS.  ALSO, THEY\nHAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT\nRESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES'\nDISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR\nACTIONS.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND\nDEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   4.  FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, [PRESIDENT\nALFREDO] CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF\nNEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN.  THIS ATTITUDE BY THE\nARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO\nCIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF\nTHE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT\nBE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL.\n\n   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO\nSTAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nWILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL\nLEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER.

BUCHI IS HIS MAN.\n\n   TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE.\nTHEY JUST HAD TO CHANGE A LETTER OF BUCHI'S PROPAGANDISTIC SLOGANS TO\nRESTORE THE TRUTH: BUCHI IS NOT THE MAN; RATHER, HE REPRESENTS HUNGER.\n\n   IN ITS 15TH CONGRESS THE PCCH MADE A CALL TO DEFEAT THE MINISTER\nWHO HAS MADE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE POOR, THE MINISTER WHO HAS NOW BECOME\nA DEMAGOGUE AND IS PROMISING THE MOON AND AN UNREALISTIC WORLD FOR THE\nPEOPLE; THAT IS, THE MINISTER WHO IS PROMISING EVERYTHING HE FAILED TO\nACCOMPLISH IN HIS YEARS AS MINISTER.\n\n   BUCHI'S INSINCERE PROMISES ARE SURPASSED ONLY BY ANOTHER TALKATIVE\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE REGIME: MR ERRAZURIZ.\n\n   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM THEN ADDED: IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE VICTORY OF\nDEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE UNITED FORCES OF ALL THOSE\nWHO HOPE FOR LIBERTY.\n\n   WE HEREBY CALL FOR THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF COMMANDOS FOR\nDEMOCRACY AND BROAD COMMITTEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DISPLAY\nINITIATIVES, ENCOURAGE IMAGINATION, AND FORM CARAVANS OF PEOPLE WHO\nWILL GIVE EXPLANATIONS FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND FROM PERSON TO PERSON,\nIMPLEMENTING A FERVENT AND OVERWHELMING DYNAMIC CAPABLE OF CHANGING\nCHILE ON 14 DECEMBER 1989.\n\n   OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED AN OUTSTANDING ROLE IN THE CRUCIAL\nCROSSROADS OF THE 20TH CENTURY.  THEY ARE PLAYING IT NOW, FIGHTING\nWHOLEHEARTEDLY, CONVINCED THAT THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY WILL REPRESENT\nA SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, AN EMPHATIC AND\nRIGHTEOUS NO TO IMPUNITY, AND A SUBSTANTIVE YES TO LIBERTY FOR ALL\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS AND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI [NATIONAL\nINTELLIGENCE CENTER].\n\n   THE OUTSTANDING COMMUNIST LEADER AND INTELLECTUAL SAID THAT THESE\nARE DAYS FOR GENEROSITY AND SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR.  SEEKING DEMOCRACY, WE\nARE SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THOSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISAGREEMENTS\nIN THE PAST.  WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE MOTIVATED BY\nDIFFERENT POLITICAL CONCEPTS, THIS IS A CREATIVE TIME FOR A COMMON\nDENOMINATOR, JOINT ACTIONS, AND FOR EVERYONE TO LEND A HAND.\n\n   IF THE OPPOSITION MARCHES UNITED TOWARD 14 DECEMBER, IT WILL\nACHIEVE A OVERWHELMING VICTORY THAT WILL BE REGISTERED IN CHILEAN\nHISTORY AS A GOLDEN DATE OF EXTRAORDINARY SIGNIFICANCE.\n\n   SUCH A VICTORY WILL FINALLY RESTORE A RIGHT THAT HAS REPEATEDLY\nBEEN REQUESTED AND VIOLATED: THE RIGHT TO REJOICE AND TO TRUST IN THE\nFUTURE WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE WILL SLIP UNNOTICED THROUGH THE\nSHADOWS OF THE NIGHT TO KILL A CHILEAN WITH IMPUNITY.\n\n   THE PEOPLE, ADDED VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, ARE BEGINNING TO PAINT THE\nWALLS WITH A SLOGAN: THE PEOPLE WIN, THE DICTATORSHIP IS OVER.  THE\nDICTATORSHIP WILL END AND THE PEOPLE WILL WIN.\n\n   IF WE WIN IN 14 DECEMBER AND DOUBTLESSLY WE WILL, AND IF WE --\nALWAYS ACTING IN UNISON -- IMMEDIATELY SPOIL PINOCHET'S PLANS, WE WILL\n[WORD INDISTINCT] THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE PERPETUAL\nBOSS.\n\n   THE TOP LEADER OF CHILEAN COMMUNISTS WARNED THAT THE DANGERS AND\nDIFFICULTIES DEMAND THAT WE REMAIN ALERT AND WORK EVEN HARDER.  WE\nMUST BURY ALL ATTEMPTS BY THE GENERAL AND HIS FAITHFULS TO STOP OR\nREVERSE CHILE'S PROGRESS TOWARD NEW HORIZONS.\n\n   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN, DURING A\nMEETING AT THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PARTY OFFICES,\nEXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A TRULY DEMOCRATIC\nGOVERNMENT THAT WILL MAKE ALL CHILEANS ACTIVE AGAIN IN DEMOCRATIC\nLIFE.  THIS PURPOSE REFLECTS THE SENTIMENTS OF A VAST MAJORITY OF THE\nPEOPLE WHO WANT TO TURN THE BLOODY PAGE OF THE DICTATORSHIP AND PUT AN\nEND TO POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NEGLECT AND TO THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN\nHUMANS, BETWEEN PARIAHS AND PRIVILEGED ONES, AND BETWEEN FIRST-CLASS,\nSECOND-CLASS, OR THIRD-CLASS PEOPLE, WHERE SOME ENJOY EVERY RIGHT\nWHILE OTHERS ARE DENIED EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE.\n\n   IN HIS SPEECH OVER A PARTIAL RADIO NETWORK, THE PCCH SECRETARY\nGENERAL SAID: WE DREAM ABOUT AND STRIVE FOR A CHILE WITHOUT MISSING\nPEOPLE, WITHOUT EXECUTED PEOPLE, WITHOUT BURNED YOUTHS, WITHOUT\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS, WITHOUT EXILES -- A FATHERLAND OF EQUALS AMONG\nEQUALS.

ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE\nRAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS,\nSMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND\nCRIMINALS.

RANGEL MAINTAINED THAT VENEZUELA ANNUALLY SERVES AS A\nBRIDGE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING WORTH SOME $20 BILLION.  FURTHERMORE, HE\nSAID, THE EXPENSIVE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED\nRESOURCES OBTAINED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   THE FIGURES GIVEN BY RANGEL ARE EQUIVALENT TO 66 PERCENT OF THE\nVENEZUELAN FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME $30 MILLION THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE.  MOREOVER, RANGEL SAID,\nDURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT CONCLUDED WITH THE ELECTION OF\nCARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IN DECEMBER 1988, POLITICAL PARTIES INVESTED SOME\n5 BILLION BOLIVARES (SOME $135 MILLION) IN PROPAGANDA.  THIS FIGURE IS\nEXCESSIVE IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW,\nTHE STATE ONLY CONTRIBUTES 100 MILLION BOLIVARES ($2.7 MILLION) FOR\nTHE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HELD EVERY 5 YEARS.\n\n   RANGEL ADDED THAT THE POSSIBLE TRANSFER OF COLOMBIAN DRUG\nTRAFFICKING OPERATION CENTERS TO VENEZUELA IS VERY WORRYING IF ONE\nTAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE OPENLY\nADMITTED THE LACK OF VIGILANCE AT THE BORDERS.  HOWEVER, WHILE\nCOLOMBIA IS ATTEMPTING, PERHAPS BELATEDLY, NOT TO YIELD TO THE\nECONOMIC POWER AND VIOLENCE OF DRUGS, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO AWARENESS\nIN VENEZUELA ABOUT THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY THE ALLEGED CHANGE OF\nADDRESS WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, IS BEING PLANNED BY\nCOLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0430 (LSI)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"*","INCIDENT: DATE":"*","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"*","INCIDENT: TYPE":"*","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"*","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"*","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"*","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"*","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"*","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"*","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"*","PHYS TGT: ID":"*","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"*","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"*","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"*","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"*","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"*","HUM TGT: NAME":"*","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"*","HUM TGT: TYPE":"*","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"*","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"*","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"*","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"*"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.114371Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T14:44:05.851596Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":10,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42775,"annotations":[{"id":2954,"completed_by":8,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-22T18:03:07.161239Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T18:03:07.161275Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.079,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ddfcf269-4828-407a-8c84-95a9b53de0a7","last_action":null,"task":42775,"project":14,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":3034,"completed_by":11,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-23T14:13:26.796671Z","updated_at":"2023-06-23T14:13:26.796705Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.664,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"d2f70452-4fb8-47d8-a582-8a64abafc279","last_action":null,"task":42775,"project":14,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":3233,"completed_by":10,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Questionable event"]},"id":"NK0208hsWF","from_name":"comment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-26T13:31:15.388565Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T13:31:15.388599Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":129.809,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"69d8d1e5-d3f9-49a4-8e49-83132fe06a0d","last_action":null,"task":42775,"project":14,"updated_by":10,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"c572f4d5-dev-muc3-0401-0500.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [GARCIA] [TEXT]\n[CONTINUED] IT IS CLEAR THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE\nNORTH.  IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS\nAND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE\nIDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS.  IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN\nIDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE\nSTATES OF THE SOUTH.  UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND\nPROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO\nELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET.\n\n   WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME.  IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD\nTHEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES.\n\n   WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES\nTHAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS.  I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR\nSTATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION.  WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE\nUNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS.  WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY.\n\n   ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT\nPROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET.  IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO\nCALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR\nMOVEMENT.  WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL\nBASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES.\n\n   MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE\nSTRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY.  THIS CAN BE\nVIEWED AS A SUGGESTION.  IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO\nRECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE\nINTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.\nTHESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF\nTHE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER.\n\n   ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY\nADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE\nPOLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES\nCOMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER\n-- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT.  WITHOUT\nTHE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES\nOF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY\nSERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS\nSPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.\n\n   IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF\nCONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION.  YET IT IS ALSO TRUE\nTHAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS.  LIKE\nNEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER.\n\n   DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH\nMARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY.\nDRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN\nCOLOMBIA.\n\n   I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE\nSHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE,\nWE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE\nDEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION.\n\n   THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT\nTOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL.\n\n   THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION.  IT\nINVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE,\nAND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER.\n\n   THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL\nTREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT.\n\n   OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND\nUNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT.  THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT\nMUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT\nIS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU.\n\n   FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD\nSTRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH.  THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR\nNATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST\nDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR\nFAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST\nCOLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE\nNATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.  WE CAME TO DEFEND\nIDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT.  WE CAME TO DEMAND FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT AND\nTHE RECOGNITION OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE DEBT.  WE ARE HERE TO\nREITERATE OUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE UNITED\nBEHIND 28 YEARS AGO.\n\n   I SALUTE THE NATIONS OF THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT.  THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH.

INCIDENTALLY, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN IN MEDELLIN.\n\n   [ISAYEV] YES, WHILE WORKING IN LATIN AMERICA AS A CORRESPONDENT FOR\nUSSR STATE TELEVISION AND RADIO I WAS ABLE TO VISIT MEDELLIN ONCE.\nTHERE WAS A SEMINAR THERE ON THE PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.\nOUTWARDLY IT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE TOWN, VERY GREEN, SITUATED ON A\nPLAIN, AND IT IS CALLED ETERNALLY BLOSSOMING.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IN\nMEDELLIN BURSTS OF SUBMACHINEGUN FIRE RANG OUT SUDDENLY IN THE STREETS\nAND I UNDERSTOOD THEN THAT I WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE COCAINE MAFIA.\nTWO CLANS OF BANDITS WERE EXCHANGING FIRE AND PASSERS-BY LITERALLY HAD\nTO RUN AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY COULD.\n\n   LOCAL COLLEAGUES SHOWED ME A HUGE DISTRICT CONSISTING OF LUXURIOUS\nVILLAS WHERE THE GODFATHERS OF THE COLOMBIA DRUG MAFIA LIVE.  IT IS\nDIFFICULT TO EVEN APPROACH THESE HOUSES: THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY BARBED\nWIRE AND THERE ARE VIDEO CAMERAS AND WATCH TOWERS.  IF YOU DECIDE TO\nGO FAIRLY CLOSE THE GUARDS WILL OPEN FIRE WITHOUR WARNING.  I WAS ALSO\nABLE TO SEE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY CASTLE, A RARE AND EXTREMELY\nBEAUTIFUL BUILDING, A GENUINE ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENT.  THIS CASTLE\nBELONGS TO ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MAFIA, CARLOS LEHDER.\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] YES, YURIY NIKOLAEVICH, BUT HOW WAS THE MEDELLIN\nCARTEL FORMED?  SOME INFORMATION ON ITS HISTORY, IF YOU COULD.\n\n   [ISAYEV] BY RIGHTS THE FOUNDER OF THE CARTEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE\nCARLOS ENRIQUE LEHDER, WHO WAS ABLE TO UNITE THE COCAINE MAFIA OF\nCOLOMBIA AROUND HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTIES.  A FEW WORDS\nABOUT LEHDER HIMSELF: HE IS A DESPERATE EXTREMIST WHO HOLDS NOTHING\nSACRED.  HE HAS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN LIVES ON HIS CONSCIENCE.  IT IS NOT\nFOR NOTHING THAT HIS FRIENDS GAVE HIM AT VARIOUS TIMES THE NICK NAMES\nRUM ROBIN HOOD, THE DRUGS BARON, AND SO ON.  CARLOS LEHDER IS\nDISTINGUISHED FOR HIS AUDACITY AND A RESTLESS DISPOSITION.  TOGETHER\nWITH HIM OTHER COLOMBIAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN THIS\nADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS, NAMELY THE OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FAMILIES.  AT THE\nEND OF THE EIGHTIES [AS HEARD] A COCAINE WAR BEGAN BETWEEN THESE THREE\nCLANS.  LATER, HOWEVER, THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND THE MEDELLIN\nCARTEL WAS FORMED\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] IN THE PRESS MANY REPORTS HAVE APPEARED STATING THAT\nLITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE CARTEL.\nIS THIS TRUE?\n\n   [ISAYEV] THE CARTEL'S ANNUAL INCOME, AS THE PRESS CLAIMS, IS $8\nBILLION.  TO SKETCH THE SCALE OF COCAINE OPERATIONS I WILL REMIND YOU\nTHAT IN 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARTEL BIGWIGS PROPOSED TO THE\nGOVERNMENT TO CLEAR COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE FOREIGN DEBT WITHIN A WEEK --\nAND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS $9 BILLION -- IF THE GOVERNMENT\nWOULD RELEASE MAFIA MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.  NOT VERY LONG AGO\nA WEST GERMAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE\nWORLD AND ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- JORGE OCHOA -- IS\nBY NO MEANS LAST ON THAT LIST.  I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER CASE\nTHAT CHARACTERIZES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DRUG MAFIA'S MEANS. FOUR\nYEARS AGO IT CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE CARTEL HAD TAKEN PART IN\nNEGOTIATIONS ON BUYING A WHOLE CONSIGNMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES,\nSEVERAL MILITARY HELICOPTERS, AND OTHER MODERN WEAPONS.\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] HOW IS THIS LETHAL ARSENAL USED?\n\n   [ISAYEV] IT IS COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT THE CARTEL COULD NOT EXIST\nWITHOUT A COMPLETE ARMY OF MERCENARY KILLERS AND INFORMANTS WHO HAVE\nPENETRATED INTO LITERALLY ALL SPHERES OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY,\nPARLIAMENT, AND THE ARMY.  THE MAIN TARGET OF THE MAFIOSI ARE\nPROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THREATEN THE DRUGS\nBUSINESS.  I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE SAME CARLOS LEHDER IN 1984\nORGANIZED THE ASSASSINATION OF LARA BONILLA, THE COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF\nJUSTICE.  IN 1986 GUILLERMO CANO, THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE\nNEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR WAS MURDERED, AND IT WAS BASICALLY AFTER THIS\nMUDER THAT THE HUNT FOR LEHDER BEGAN.  IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS\nARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO U.S. JUSTICE, WHICH SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE\nIMPRISONMENT.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGREEMENT\nBETWEEN THE U.S. AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS ON THE EXTRADITION OF\nESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] IF WE TAKE THE PRESENT WAR -- IT CANNOT BE CALLED\nANYTHING ELSE -- WHAT WERE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSES?

TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE CALLED, \"AMERICA'S TOUGHEST\nDOMESTIC TEST IN DECADES\" DURING HIS STERN ADDRESS ON TUESDAY, THE US\nLEADER HAS GIVEN A NEW BOOST TO THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE\nAGAINST NARCOTICS.\n\n   THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY,\nMOST OF ALL BY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY COLOMBIA WHICH IS\nFIGHTING A DESPERATE BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE BARONS.  THE NEWS FROM\nBOGOTA IS SIMPLY FRIGHTENING.  IN THE COUNTRY'S LONG WAR AGAINST DRUG\nDEALERS, NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW -- THE MERCILESS KILLING\nOF SECURITY OFFICERS AND THEIR RELATIVES -- HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.\nSHOULD COLOMBIA LOSE THIS WAR AGAINST COCAINE BARONS, DRUG LORDS IN\nOTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL FLEX THEIR MUSCLES TOO.  TO PUT IT\nPLAINLY, COLOMBIA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS WAR.  BUT WHETHER SHE\nWINS OR LOSSES THIS BATTLE DEPENDS ON WHAT ASSISTANCE THE UNITED\nSTATES CAN PROVIDE TO THIS LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.\n\n   HERE, COLOMBIA FACES DIFFICULT OPTIONS.  WHILE SHE HAS ACCEPTED\nSOME LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, FROM WASHINGTON, SHE\nMAINTAINS HERE OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF US TROOPS IN TACKLING WHAT SHE\nRIGHTLY REGARDS AS A DOMESTIC CRISIS.  THE STATEMENT BY MR BUSH ON\nWEDNESDAY HAS SO FAR MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS OPPOSITION.  THE\nPROBLEM FACING BOGOTA IS, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE LOGISTIC SUPPORT\nFROM US WOULD HELP, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT OVERNIGHT RAISE THE STRENGTH\nOF ITS ANI-NARCOTIC SECURITY FORCES.  WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nOFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, BOGOTA CAN, OF COURSE, BUY ARMS FOR USE\nAGAINST DRUG BARONS.  BUT THE BATTLE WILL STILL BE HARD AND LONG.\n\n   IN FIGHTING THIS RELENTLESS BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE DEALERS,\nCOLOMBIA HAS MADE ONE PERFECTLY VALID POINT, MORE THAN ONCE.  TRUE, IT\nIS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO WIN ITS\nINTERNAL WAR, WITH ALL THE HELP THAT WASHINGTON CAN PROVIDE.  BUT THE\nREAL BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS MUST BE FOUGHT WITHIN THE UNITED\nSTATES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO AND ALL OTHER\nCITIES.  THIS IS THE MARKET FOR THE COCAINE BARONS OF COLOMBIA OR FOR\nTHE DRUGS PRODUCED IN THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN TRIANGLE IN ASIA.  AND IT IS\nALSO WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHERE ALL THE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION,\nSOME CONTROLLED BY US CITIZENS, THRIVE UNDER THE EYES OF THE US LAW\nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY ASK IF ENOUGH\nHAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE US END.\n\n   THIS STATEMENT BY MR BUSH SUGGESTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS\nRECOGNISED THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  A\nMAJOR PORTION OF THE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI-DRUG WAR WILL BE\nUSED IN STRENGTHENING THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED\nSTATES.  BUT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE US CONGRESS\nWHETHER THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH IN THAT DIRECTION.

I\nEXPRESSED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD VOTE AGAINST\nPINOCHET, DESPITE PINOCHET'S RESOURCES AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE\nAND TERRORIST METHODS THAT WERE USED TO INTIMIDATE THE MASSES.  IT\nWOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PEOPLE TO FORGET THE MANY CRIMES AND\nMONSTROSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.\n\n   IN EFFECT, THE PLEBISCITE WAS A HARSH BLOW FOR PINOCHET.

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING, BUT THE ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT ENTAIL A SOLID\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING YET.

WE COULD ALMOST SAY THAT HE WILL STAY ON AS A SORT OF\nSENTINEL, A POWER ON WHICH THE COUNTRY'S DESTINY WOULD CONTINUE TO\nHANG FOR SOME TIME TO COME.  WHETHER HE CAN REALLY FULFILL THE GOALS\nHE HAS SET FOR HIMSELF REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN HE\nWILL NOT GIVE UP POWER WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.  ONLY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE\nCAN MAKE THIS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE AND FULL\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING, AN OPENING WITHOUT ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE\nREGIME HAS WRITTEN INTO ITS CONSTITUTION, WHICH GRANTS HIM ALL OF\nTHESE RIGHTS -- TO BE A SENATOR FOR LIFE, AND, IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT\nFAIL ME, TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY FOR AN ADDITIONAL 8 YEARS.\nLOOK AT HIS HARANGUES.  HIS HARANGUES ARE STILL AGGRESSIVE, HAUGHTY,\nAND THREATENING.  WE HEAR WARNINGS.  WE HEAR APPEALS TO THE ARMY TO\nREMAIN UNITED, BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF.\n\n   I THINK HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CORNERED BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE,\nBECAUSE A NEW STAGE WILL BEGIN AFTER THE ELECTIONS.

WE MIGHT EVEN ADD THAT THE ARENA GOVERNMENT HAS\nBEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE FROM THE BEGINNING, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE\nTELA SUMMIT WHICH APPEALED TO THE SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES TO HOLD\nDIALOGUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE REBELS.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S\nATTEMPT TO SECURE THE FORCEFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF THE GUERRILLAS AND\nHIS ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THESE FORCES WITH THE NICARAGUAN\nCOUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES ALSO FAILED.\n\n   THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AND ITS\nWILLINGNESS TO SECURE A DEFINITIVE PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE IN EVIDENCE\nAT THE NEXT MEETINGS.  MEANWHILE, THE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN\nTHE COUNTRY APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE.

LET US RECALL THAT\nLESS THAN 1 WEEK AGO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REBEL FORCES AND THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT MET IN MEXICO, THUS LAUNCHING A DIALOGUE AIMED\nAT A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  THE PARTIES AGREED TO CONTINUE THESE\nTALKS IN COSTA RICA ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER, HOWEVER, EVEN THE FIRST\nROUND OF TALKS IN MEXICO SHOWED THAT CONTINUING THE WAR WAS POINTLESS\nBECAUSE NEITHER OF THE PARTIES IS CAPABLE OF MILITARY DEFEATING THE\nOTHER.  THUS, THE ONLY POSSIBLE VICTORY FOR ALL IS THE VICTORY OF\nCOMMON SENSE.  THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH NATIONAL DIALOGUE.\nTHE REBELS HAVE CORRECTLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT NO PRECONDITIONS CAN BE\nSET FOR CONTINUING DIALOGUE, AND LESS STILL CAN IT BE DEMANDED THAT\nTHE FMLN COMBATANTS SHOULD UNILATERALLY SURRENDER THEIR ARMS.\n\n   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS DEMAND IS BEING MADE WHILE THE SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENT IS GETTING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY AID FROM THE UNITED STATES\nAND, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESMAN, IT HAS NO PLANS\nTO DISCONTINUE THIS AID.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN MILITARY IS USING U.S.-MADE WEAPONS ONLY AGAINST THE\nREBELS AND NOT AGAINST ANY FOREIGN ENEMY.  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT\nTHROUGHOUT THE 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THE UNITED STATES\nHAS SUPPLIED ALMOST $4 BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY AND NONMILITARY AID\nTO THAT COUNTRY.  THANKS TO THIS ASSISTANCE, 70,000 SALVADORANS HAVE\nBEEN KILLED AND OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO\nSAVE THEIR LIVES.\n\n   WE CAN SEE THAT ADDITIONAL U.S. MILITARY AID WILL INFLICT FURTHER\nUNTOLD SUFFERING AND MISFORTUNES ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

ROUTES,\nBRINGING INSTABILITY TO A COUNTRY THAT IS EXPERIENCING A WAVE OF\nVIOLENCE FROM VARIOUS SECTORS.\n\n   THE DIPLOMATS BELIEVE THAT UP TO 200 COLOMBIANS LINKED TO THE\nMEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS ARE NOW OPERATING IN GUATEMALA AND THAT\nABOUT 500 KG OF COCAINE PASS EVERY WEEK THROUGH THE COUNTRY,\nESSENTIALLY ENROUTE TO THE U.S. MARKET.\n\n   THE INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITY COINCIDES WITH A NEW WAVE\nOF KIDNAPPINGS, BOMBINGS, AND MURDERS IN GUATEMALA, AWAKENING FEARS\nTHAT THE COUNTRY WILL RETURN TO THE VIOLENCE PREVALENT AT THE\nBEGINNING OF THE DECADE, WHEN THOUSANDS WERE KILLED BY DEATH SQUADS\nDURING MILITARY REGIMES.\n\n   SINCE AUGUST, A PROMINENT POLITICIAN, A WELL-KNOWN BANKER, AND AT\nLEAST FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED.  SEVERAL BOMBS HAVE\nEXPLODED IN THE CAPITAL IN RECENT MONTHS AND STUDENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS\nACTIVISTS ARE MISSING.\n\n   \"ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE CANNOT BE BLAMED ON A [WORDS INDISTINCT], BUT\nTHE INCREASE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS CLEARLY AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN.\"\n\n   IN ADDITION TO THE COCAINE, WHICH THE DIPLOMATS SAY IS TAKEN TO THE\nUNITED STATES ABOARD LIGHT PLANES OR IN AUTOMOBILES THROUGH MEXICO AND\nTEXAS, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN\nGUATEMALA.  ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF HECTARES PLANTED\nWENT FROM 225 IN 1985 TO 1,500 THIS YEAR.\n\n   THERE ARE INSISTENT RUMORS THAT BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS\nMURDERED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON 25 AUGUST BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LAUNDER\nDRUG MONEY.  THERE IS OPEN TALK IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT IMPORTANT\nPOLITICIANS BEING LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, THE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK\nSUCH SPECULATION AND THEY ADD THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SEVERAL\nINTERESTS ARE WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY'S FRAGILE DEMOCRACY.\n\n   \"IT SEEMS AS IF SEVERAL STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED AT THE SAME TIME,\"\nA DIPLOMAT SAID.\n\n   WHILE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS GIVEN\nGUATEMALA A RESPITE, AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES DURING WHICH IT\nIS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF\nPOLITICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,200 LEFTIST\nGUERRILLAS ARE STILL FIGHTING IN THE MOUNTAINS.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY HAS FACED TWO COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE\nDEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED IN 1986.\n\n   THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING, WITH ITS TIES TO THE LAND-OWNING OLIGARCHY,\nCONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  IT HAS BLOCKED A\nMAJORITY OF REFORMS THAT CEREZO HAS TRIED TO INTRODUCE AND, ACCORDING\nTO THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, IT HAS PROMOTED DISCONTENT AMONG THE ARMED\nFORCES' MID-LEVEL OFFICERS.\n\n   \"THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING IS UNDOUBTEDLY BEHIND PART OF THE VIOLENCE,\"\nSAID A DIPLOMAT.  \"IT COULD BE TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO\nOVERREACT OR CAUSE THE ARMY TO GET INVOLVED.\"\n\n   AS IF TO CONFIRM THIS, A POLICE ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED\nAGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIONEL SISNIEGA, A NOTED\nPOLITICIAN WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COUP\nATTEMPTS SINCE 1954, ON CHARGES OF HEADING A GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR\nMUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   DIPLOMATS HAVE ALSO POINTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF ACTIVITIES BY\nLEFT-WING GUERRILLAS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO TOPPLE SUCCESSIVE\nGOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES.\n\n   \"NOWADAYS THEY ARE USING MUCH MORE OBVIOUS TACTICS, ERECTING\nBARRICADES ON HIGHWAYS AND OCCUPYING SMALL TOWNS NEAR THE CAPITAL,\"\nONE DIPLOMAT SAID.\n\n   FEAR THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEVENTIES WILL RETURN MAY ALSO\nCONTRIBUTE TOWARD A RESURGENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\nTHAT CROSS OVER TO MEXICO.\n\n   MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL\nAMERICANS DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.\n\n   THE DIPLOMATS FEEL THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT WILL WEATHER THE\nVIOLENCE AND PASS IT ONTO HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 1990.\n\n   \"PERHAPS THE SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF THE PREPARATION FOR\nELECTIONS IN GUATEMALA,\" A DIPLOMAT SAID.  \"THINGS WILL PROBABLY\nWORSEN NEXT YEAR.\"  ","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0502 (UMASS)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"1 (OPTIONAL)","INCIDENT: DATE":"01 AUG 89 - 22 SEP 89","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"GUATEMALA","INCIDENT: TYPE":"ATTACK","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"ACCOMPLISHED","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"-","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"-","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"TERRORIST ACT","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"-","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"-","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"-","PHYS TGT: ID":"-","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"-","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"-","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"-","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-","HUM TGT: NAME":"-","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"\"PROMINENT POLITICIAN\" \/ \"POLITICIAN\"; \"WELL-KNOWN BANKER\" \/ \"BANKER\"; \"UNIVERSITY STUDENTS\" \/ \"STUDENTS\"","HUM TGT: TYPE":"POLITICAL FIGURE: \"PROMINENT POLITICIAN\" \/ \"POLITICIAN\"; CIVILIAN: \"WELL-KNOWN BANKER\" \/ \"BANKER\"; CIVILIAN: \"UNIVERSITY STUDENTS\" \/ \"STUDENTS\"","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"1: \"PROMINENT POLITICIAN\" \/ \"POLITICIAN\"; 1: \"WELL-KNOWN BANKER\" \/ \"BANKER\"; 5-: \"UNIVERSITY STUDENTS\" \/ \"STUDENTS\"","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"DEATH: \"PROMINENT POLITICIAN\" \/ \"POLITICIAN\"; DEATH: \"WELL-KNOWN BANKER\" \/ \"BANKER\"; DEATH: \"UNIVERSITY STUDENTS\" \/ \"STUDENTS\"","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.128300Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T15:21:55.439601Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":10,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42877,"annotations":[{"id":2699,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":202,"end":208,"text":"MURDER","labels":["trigger"]},"id":"J_U-hEpO52","from_name":"tag","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-21T20:23:53.212001Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T20:23:53.212035Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":38.492,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42877,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"fb5478a0-dev-muc3-0501-0600.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   BOGOTA, 22 SEP 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] THE 13TH\nINFANTRY BRIGADE HAS REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING A SERIES OF ACTIONS BY\nSPECIAL URBAN TROOPS, FOUR PERSONS WHO ARE APPARENTLY INVOLVED IN THE\nMURDER OF DR LUIS CARLOS GALAN SARMIENTO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.

ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, AN\nEFFECTIVE CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE\nCONTROL OF VIOLENT ACTIONS BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.\nMERINO MADE REFERENCE TO THE DOUBTS THAT CERTAIN MILITARY COMMAND\nSECTORS HAVE ABOUT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THAT THESE DOUBTS ARE\nPRESENT, MAINLY BECAUSE THE REBELS HAVE NOT KEPT THEIR PUBLIC PROMISES\nCONCERNING MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL\nCOMMENTED THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WOULD LEAD TO\nNEGOTIATIONS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS MILITARY TROOP REDUCTIONS,\nTHAT MUST BE ACCEPTED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  LET US HEAR VICE PRESIDENT\nMERINO:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT THE FMLN AND EVEN\nTHE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE PROMISES THAT THEY NEVER KEPT.  THE\nARMED FORCES ARE A PERMANENT INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY\nSUFFERED THE NONCOMPLIANCE OF AGREEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE\nPREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WITH THE FMLN.  NOW, THE LACK OF TRUST MUST BE\nOVERCOME WITH SPECIFIC ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE.  HERE, WE HAVE SOMETHING\nTHAT MUST BE CLEARLY APPRECIATED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT;\nTHEY ARE AN INSTITUTION.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS THE GENERAL COMMANDER\nOF THE ARMED FORCES.  THUS, THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION IS ALSO\nINCLUDED IN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S STATEMENTS. [END RECORDING]\n\n   ACCORDING TO MERINO, COMMENTARIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL\nMILITARY COMMANDERS ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS COMMENTARIES OUTSIDE ANY\nAGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY REACH WITH THE REBELS.

THIS IS LOGICAL, AS WHEN THERE IS NO\nAGGRESSION, THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TO COUNTER IT. [END RECORDING]\n\n   MERINO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT FOR\nTHE FMLN TO DRASTICALLY DECREASE STREET VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR, SUCH\nAS THE VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS RECENTLY.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] HOSTILITIES ARE NOT ONLY THOSE ACTIONS\nTHAT INCLUDE THE USE OF MILTARY FORCE, SUCH AS MINES, BOMBS, AND SO\nON.  THEY ALSO INCLUDE FMLN MASS ORGANIZATION ACTIONS THAT ARE CARRIED\nOUT MAINLY IN SAN SALVADOR AND ARE CREATING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF\nDESTABILIZATION.  IT IS A KIND OF URBAN TERRORISM, AS THESE GROUPS ARE\nDISTORTING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST OR THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION.  THESE\nORGANIZATIONS ARE NO LONGER ONLY CARRYING A MESSAGE, BUT HAVE STARTED\nTO DESTROY AND DAMAGE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND\nTHREATEN THE CITIZENS' INTEGRITY.  THUS, YOU SEE HERE A DIRECT\nRELATIONSHIP WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS AND\nCEASEFIRE MUST INCLUDE URBAN ACTIONS, AS WELL.

THE GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS TERRIFYING PHOTOGRAPHS IN\nTHE NEWSPAPERS OF WORKERS TIED BY THEIR THUMBS, AND BLINDFOLDED IN THE\nMOST REPULSIVE STYLES OF THE DEATH SQUADS.\n\n   WE HAVE REACHED SUCH A STATE OF PROVOCATION THAT VICE PRESIDENT\nFRANCISCO MERINO IS TRYING TO HUMILIATE PUBLICLY THE PEOPLE'S SECTORS\nBY CALLING THEM TRASH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN TRIED TO SOLVE THE\nCASE OF THE WAR HANDICAPPED; THERE ARE 45 OF THEM OCCUPYING THE\nMETROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL.  THE ONLY ANSWER TO THEIR DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL\nATTENTION ABROAD IS THE RIOT POLICEMEN THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THREATEN\nATTACKING [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO ACHIEVE THE FREEDOM OF 11 INNOCENT\nYOUTHS WHO WERE CAPTURED AT A LOCAL CLINIC.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,\nTHE U.S. CONGRESS HAS APPROVED SENDING $90 MILLION TO THE FASCIST\nGOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE FINANCING THE WAR AND REPRESSION.\n\n   3.  THIS STATE OF REPRESSION AND THIS MOCKERY TO THE LEGITIMATE\nASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE FOR PEACE IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE SAY: NO MORE CAPTURES, TORTURE, MURDERS, BOMBINGS, SIEGES,\nEVICTIONS, OR HUMILIATION!\n\n   TO OUR FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, WE SAY THAT JUST LIKE WE REMAIN\nFLEXIBLE AND OPEN FOR NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL LIKEWISE BE WILLING, ABLE,\nAND READY TO ACCOMPANY THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE AND STRONGLY CARRY\nTHE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE TO ADVANCE UNTIL WE HAVE NAILED THAT\nFLAG INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ONLY WANT WAR.\n\n   THIS GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY ORDERS ALL OUR GROUPS, FIGHTERS,\nMILITIA MEMBERS, AND COLLABORATORS TO DEFEND WITH HONOR AND STRENGTH\nAND WITH THEIR WEAPONS THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT THE ENTIRE\nNATION DEMANDS.\n\n   WE HEREBY NOTIFY THAT TODAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1989, OUR FORCES HAVE\nBEGUN A NATIONAL MANEUVER THAT WE CALL \"STOP THE REPRESSION, EVERYONE\nFOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.\" OUR MANEUVER CALLS FOR\nATTACKING SEVERAL GARRISONS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE\nFOUR REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE WILL CONTINUE REPORTING ON THE\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIONS IN THE FOUR WAR FRONTS IN A FORTHCOMING\nCOMMUNIQUE.\n\n   AGAINST REPRESSION, EVERYONE FOR ACHIEVING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.","template":{"MESSAGE: ID":"DEV-MUC3-0519 (UMASS)","MESSAGE: TEMPLATE":"3 (OPTIONAL)","INCIDENT: DATE":"- 26 SEP 89","INCIDENT: LOCATION":"EL SALVADOR: GUAZAPA (TOWN)","INCIDENT: TYPE":"BOMBING","INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION":"ACCOMPLISHED","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID":"-","INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE":"BOMB: \"-\"","PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY":"STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE","PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID":"-","PERP: ORGANIZATION ID":"\"GOVERNMENT\"; \"ARMED FORCES\"","PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE":"REPORTED AS FACT: \"GOVERNMENT\"; REPORTED AS FACT: \"ARMED FORCES\"","PHYS TGT: ID":"-","PHYS TGT: TYPE":"-","PHYS TGT: NUMBER":"-","PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"-","PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-","HUM TGT: NAME":"-","HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION":"\"CIVILIAN POPULATIONS\" \/ \"POPULATIONS\"","HUM TGT: TYPE":"CIVILIAN: \"CIVILIAN POPULATIONS\" \/ \"POPULATIONS\"","HUM TGT: NUMBER":"PLURAL: \"CIVILIAN POPULATIONS\" \/ \"POPULATIONS\"","HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION":"-","HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT":"-","HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER":"-"}},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-06-07T21:56:11.130742Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T14:17:41.486895Z","inner_id":0,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":10,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42905,"annotations":[{"id":2728,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-06-21T20:37:10.134728Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T20:37:10.134763Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.22,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":42905,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"fb5478a0-dev-muc3-0501-0600.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"   SAN SALVADOR, 26 SEP 89 (ACAN -

THIS\nIS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND.\n\n   THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE\nDICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4\nMILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR.  THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR.\nTHAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK\nTHIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO\nTHIS WAR.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY\nTOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.\n\n   WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES\nOF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC\nINSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE\nINSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK\nDIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR\nTHE FMLN.  WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS\nWELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR\nSECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS\nPREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET.\n\n   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE\nCONFLICT.  THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,\nSUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE\nTRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO\nCHANGE POLICIES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND\nSUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE         \nCITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE     \nBISHOPS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND\nCONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A\nFASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL\nSALVADOR.

ANALYST ALEKSEY PAVLOV DISCUSSES THIS\nSUBJECT:\n\n   FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ISSUES, THIS NEWS\nIS NO SURPRISE. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS AS WELL AS THE RESUMPTION OF\nTHE WAR, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION WAS PRESSURED BY CERTAIN U.S.\nCIRCLES TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.\n\n   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MEDIA ARE CONDUCTING A CRUSADE TO CONVINCE\nTHE PUBLIC THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND CERTAINLY THE USSR, ARE PROVIDING\nWEAPONS TO THE [WORD INDISTINCT] REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE UNITED STATES\nCERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS\nPRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL\nPRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA.\n\n   APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN\nORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT.  THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE\nWITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE\nCONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS\nUNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT.\n\n   THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH\nNICARAGUA AS A MASK.  HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS,\nINCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS\nAND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT\nCONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE\nTHAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.  THE\nCRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS\nWHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY.\n\n   IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE\nBREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN\nSAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE\nDEATH SQUADS.  IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE?  OF COURSE NOT.  MOST\nPROBABLY THESE DEATH SQUADS RECEIVED ORDERS TO MAKE SUCH THREATS WITH\nA VIEW TOWARD THE DIPLOMATIC BREAK.\n\n   BY WHAT CAN BE SEEN, THE ACTION OF DEATH SQUADS IS COMMON PRACTICE\nFOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THIS DIPLOMATIC BREAK IS A\nSERIOUS ACT FOR WHICH CRISTIANI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE.  HONDURAN\nPRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO CONSIDERS THIS ACTION A GREAT DANGER TO\nPEACE IN THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS AN UNQUESTIONABLE FACT.

IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF THE SALVADORAN\nCONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES\nWERE THE FIRST ONES TO ESCALATE THE WAR BY LAUNCHING INDISCRIMINATE\nATTACKS AND AIR BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN DENSELY\nPOPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAD BEEN DOING\nTHIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THE\nDAMAGE THAT THIS CAUSES THE POPULATION, SINCE 1987 THE FMLN HAS MADE\nPROPOSALS TO SCALE DOWN THE WAR AND SUSPEND THE USE OF AIRCRAFT AND\nAVIATION EQUIPMENT.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE HYPOCRITICAL, AS THE\nGOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS TURNED AIRCRAFT INTO REAL INSTRUMENTS OF\nGENOCIDE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\n\n   2.  THE POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS TURNED\nCENTRAL AMERICA INTO A HUGE ARMS MARKET WHEREBY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF\nSOVIET AND U.S. WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO AIR MISSILES, HAVE BEEN\nINTRODUCED INTO THE AREA.  THIS HAS CREATED A FLOURISHING BLACK MARKET\nFOR WEAPONS, WHERE SALVADORAN AND HONDURAN MILITARY MEN AND NICARAGUAN\nCONTRAS PARTICIPATE AS BIG-TIME SMUGGLERS.\n\n   3.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN OF ACCUSATIONS\nAGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF PUTTING UP A\nSMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE GENOCIDE IT HAS UNLEASHED AND TO DIVERT THE\nATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMANDING:\n\n       A) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STOP THE MASSIVE AND\nINDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AND THE\nPERSECUTION AGAINST THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND GRASS ROOTS\nMOVEMENTS;\n\n       B) AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR UP THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT\nPRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ALONG WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THESE AND SIMILAR CRIMES; AND,\n\n       C) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPT THE CEASE-FIRE IT HAS\nHERETOFORE REJECTED AND JUSTIFY ITS INTRANSIGENT AND IRRATIONAL\nPOSITION.\n\n   4.  CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SUSPEND RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BASED\nON AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF MISSILES FOR THE FMLN IS NOT REASONABLE, NOT\nEVEN BY SAYING THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE SALVADORAN\nWAR.

JULIO CESAR CASTRO RAMIREZ AND JULIO\nEUGENIA AGUILERA ESCOBAR WERE LATER ARRESTED IN SANTA ANA, AND,\nLASTLY, AIDA MARGARITA GOMEZ DE LEON WAS ARRESTED IN THE DON BOSCO\nRESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN SANTA TECLA.\n\n   SERRANO SAID HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF CREDHO AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE\nAFOREMENTIONED CHURCH.  HE ASSERTED THAT HE LEARNED ON 29 OCTOBER THAT\nIN THE CHURCHYARD TWO TRUCKS WERE LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES, WHICH WERE\nHURLED THE NEXT DAY AT THE MILITARY COMPLEX OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT\nCHIEFS OF STAFF.  HE DECIDED TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT THIS, THEREBY\nCOVERING FOR THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO MURDER HUMBLE WORKING PEOPLE.\nSERRANO ALSO SAID THAT CREDHO IS FINANCED BY A FRONT GROUP CALLED\nDIACOMIAS, WHICH HAS NO LEGAL STATUS, BUT IS THE CHANNEL FOR AID\nTHAT IS SENT IN CASH BY SO-CALLED SOLIDARITY CHURCHES AND ASSOCIATIONS\nORGANIZED IN SWEDEN, BRITAIN, NETHERLANDS, CANADA, THE UNITED STATES,\nAND AUSTRALIA.  THIS MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED TO LUTHERAN, CATHOLIC,\nEMANUEL BAPTIST, AND EPISCOPAL CHURCHES, AS WELL AS TO THE FOUNDATION\nFOR PROMOTION OF COOPERATIVES [FUNDACION PROMOTORA DE COOPERATIVAS,\nFUNPROCOOP] AND THE FEDERATION OF COOPERATIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT\n[FEDERACION DE COOPERATIVAS PARA EL DESARROLLO, FEDECOOPADE].  THESE\nGROUPS COMPRISE DIACOMIAS AND TWICE A MONTH, ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM\nEACH GROUP MEETS AT THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO DISCUSS DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MOST OF WHICH, HE SAID, IS DELIVERED TO\nLOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE ORGANIZED THAT ARE DIRECTED BY THE\nFMLN FRONT GROUPS.

ON\nBEHALF OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER IMMEDIATELY\nEXPRESSED THE DISADVANTAGES OF APPROVING THAT PROPOSAL.\n\n   I HAVE CONSULTED WITH FORMER PRESIDENTS ALBERTO LLERAS, CARLOS\nLLERAS RESTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ, AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY ABOUT INCLUDING\nTHE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM, AND THEY FEEL THAT WITH THE\nCURRENT PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS\nBEEN DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,\nIT WOULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO USE THE REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON\nEXTRADITION.\n\n   THE COUNTRY MUST NOT DECEIVE ITSELF AS TO WHERE WE WOULD BE HEADED\nIF WE HELD A REFERENDUM ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, AND AS TO THE\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION ON THE COUNTRY'S MORALE AND ON\nDEMOCRACY'S SURVIVAL.\n\n   INITIALLY, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXTRADITING COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS\nFOR THEM TO STAND TRIAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OF EXTRADITING DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD.  EXTRADITION IS NOT\nPUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nNEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO\nPORTRAY IT.\n\n   EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL\nTREATIES.  THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE\nEXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE\nCONSTITUTION.  CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING\nPUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT\nPROVISIONS.  THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS\nIMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY\nAPPROVED.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL\nPREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT\nCOLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED\nTHROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH\nDIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY\nINFORMING THE COUNTERPART.\n\n   FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF\nCRIMINALS.  I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN\nEXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO\nITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY.  PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES\nOF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO\nEXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH\nAS DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED\nTO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH\nTHE NECESSARY LAWS.  THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT\nAGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS.  IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE\nCRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD.  SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID\nTHAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS\nELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR.  NEITHER IS TRUE.\n\n   THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED\nPRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY.  AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO\nEFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE\nMINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT\nDECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nAFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL\nCARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS\nKIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO\nLEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.

THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR\nANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN\nQUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN\nEXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT.  LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nBROUGHT US VIOLENCE.  A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK,\nFROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE.  LET\nUS NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY\nMURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND\nINTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT\nEXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE\nTRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nHOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH\nOFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE\nMURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL\nOFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO\nWANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME.  HOW THEN CAN WE\nBELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS?  CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nCAUSED THIS VIOLENCE?  CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH\nTHESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS?\n\n   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT\nHARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM.  WE KNOW\nTHAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE\nDONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.  WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS.  MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE\nSIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL\nCAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION?  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE\nAGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION?  IT\nWOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS' MONEY.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT\nWOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.  A\nREFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION\nON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST.  TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE\nREFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC\nOPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD.\n\n   CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED\nFREELY.  I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK\nINTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL\nINTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS.  I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST\nREFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO\nSERVE SELFISH INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN\nIMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS.  THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER\nPARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE\nWITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT\nDRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.  I WANT TO SAY THAT\nELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND\nMORE VIOLENCE.  THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT\nALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE\nPUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC\nTHAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE\nDANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL\nINVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS PART OF COLOMBIA'S\nOPENING TO THE PACIFIC.  THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO;\nWITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH\nINDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE\nGOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES.  THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE\nPICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE\nNATIONAL RESOLVE TO OVERCOME THEM.  WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH A PROMISING\nFUTURE, WITH HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, AND WITH VAST NATURAL RESOURCES.  A\nFEW CRIMINALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SNATCH THAT FUTURE FROM US.
