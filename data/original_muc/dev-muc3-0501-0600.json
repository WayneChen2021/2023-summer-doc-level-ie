COLOMBIA IS NO LONGER\nSEEN AS A COUNTRY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND\nNEVER WILL BE.\n\n   NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF BRAVE PEOPLE\nWHERE THE MAJORITY ARE HONEST AND HARD-WORKING.  THE WORLD HAS\nACKNOWLEDGED AND PRAISED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA, THE VICTIM OF A\nPROBLEM IT HAS NOT CREATED.\n\n   FOURTH, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS\nCONTINUE GIVING POSITIVE RESULTS.  MORE THAN 25 BANDS OF ASSASSINS\nHAVE BEEN DISMANTLED, AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED.  TWO OF\nTHE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN\nHAVE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME.

IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE UNABLE\nTO USE THEIR MONEY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT\nOPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES OFFER, THE INCENTIVES FOR THE\nBUSINESS WOULD VANISH.\n\n   IF THE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROCESS COCAINE DID\nNOT ARRIVE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG\nCOULD NOT BE PRODUCED.\n\n   IF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET WERE UNDER CONTROL, THE TERRORISTS\nWOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ARMS THEY HAVE USED TO SPILL SO\nMUCH BLOOD IN COLOMBIA.

ISSUE WILL BE DISCUSSED.\n\n   GARCIA SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS ADDRESSED TO THE FRENCH, ITALIAN,\nAND SPANISH CHIEFS OF STATE, FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, GIULIO ANDREOTTI,\nAND FELIPE GONZALEZ, RESPECTIVELY.\n\n   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TO FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, ALAN GARCIA\nSAID THAT EUROPE MUST ATTEND THIS MEETING BECAUSE IT IS A STRONG DRUG\nMARKET AND BECAUSE OF THE LINKS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKING GANGS AND\nTERRORISTS.\n\n   GARCIA CRITICIZED THE PLAN PROPOSED BY WILLIAM BENNETT, THE WHITE\nHOUSE'S MAIN ADVISER FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING AFFAIRS, ON THE GROUNDS THAT\nIT \"LACKS SERIOUSNESS AND IS INCONCEIVABLE.\" THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR\n$250 MILLION IN AID FOR COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU FOR FIGHTING DRUG\nTRAFFICKING IN 1990.\n\n   THE PERUVIAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THIS

THE 200,000 HECTARES OF COCA FARMS IN PERU\n(WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 60 PERCENT OF WORLD PRODUCTION) ARE \"DRASTICALLY\nERADICATED,\" MORE THAN 400,000 PEASANTS WILL BE LEFT \"IN ABSOLUTE\nMISERY,\" ADDING

GUATEMALA ALWAYS COMES\nUP IN CENTRAL AMERICAN NEWS.  WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT GUATEMALA.\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCIES BLOCK REPORTS FROM GUATEMALA .  WE HAVE\nLEARNED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF CHAOS AND INSTABILITY,\nREPRESSION HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST 7 MONTHS.  IT WAS REPORTED\nRECENTLY THAT 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, 2,500 WOUNDED -- MANY OF\nTHEM CRIPPLED -- AND HUNDREDS -- OVER 800 ARE MISSING. WE HAVE TAKEN\nTHE OPPORTUNITY OF A VISIT PAID BY MR RODRIGO ASTURIAS, WHO IS MEMBER\nOF THE URNG MILITARY DIRECTORATE AND IS ALSO KNOWN AS COMMANDER\nGASPAR, NOT ONLY IN GUATEMALA AND CENTRAL AMERICA BUT THROUGHOUT THE\nWORLD, TO TALK AND CLEAR SOME MATTERS PERTAINING TO GUATEMALA.\n\n   COMMANDER GASPAR: SOME STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FIND A NEGOTIATED\nSOLUTION. THAT IS, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN\nTHE GUERRILLA AND THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT.  SOME JOURNALISTS AND\nSPECIALISTS WONDER IF THE SEARCH FOR A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS\nCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN GUATEMALA. WHAT COULD YOU\nTELL US ABOUT THIS?\n\n   [ASTURIAS] I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO\nBE CLARIFIED. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND MADE A\nNEW PROPOSAL AIMED AT FINDING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL\nARMED CONFLICT OUR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING. THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION AND TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AS A FIRST STEP TO\nCREATE THE CONDITIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENTAILS AN\nINCREASED EFFORT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY. WE DO NOT THINK OF\nDIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION AS A DEMOBILIZATION ELEMENT BUT AS AN\nEXTREMELY ACTIVE ELEMENT, AS A CLARIFYING ELEMENT, TO FIND AND PUT IN\nPLACE CONSENSUS WITH DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS. THIS IS WHY ALTHOUGH THERE\nHAS BEEN, IN FACT, AN INCREASE OF REPRESSION -- WHICH BY THE WAY, IT\nWAS BRUTALLY INTENSIFIED LAST MONTH -- THE PROPOSAL TO FIND A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION AND THE CALL ALL NATIONAL SECTORS, WITHOUT\nEXCEPTION, TO BEGIN CONTACTS, TALKS, AND DIALOGUE WITH THE UNRG\nDESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO REFUSE THEM AND\nCONTINUES MAINTAINING A CLOSED POSITION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN\nTHE DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE.\n\n   [REPORTER] COMMANDER GASPAR, INSISTING IN THE LAST PART OF YOUR\nRESPONSE, WHAT ARE THE BASIS IN WHICH THIS TYPE OF TALKS AND DIALOGUE\nCOULD BE INITIATED?\n\n   [ASTURIAS] SINCE OCTOBER 1987, WHEN ITS FIRST DIALOGUE INITIATIVE\nWAS ESTABLISHED, THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID PREESTABLISHED\nCONDITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARY BUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S FUNDAMENTAL\nPROBLEMS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIALOGUE AND THE PREPARATION OF THE\nAGENDA. THE MAIN PROBLEM THE COUNTRY HAS AND HAS HAD IN THE LAST FEW\nYEARS IS THE LACK OF RESPECT TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS, THE MILITARIZATION\nOF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIETY, AND THE GENERALIZED OPPRESSION EXPERIENCED.\nTHEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THE MAIN POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE\nAGENDA IS THE DEMOCRATIZATION.\n\n   [REPORTER] SPEAKING OF THE INTERNAL SITUATION FROM THE MILITARY\nPOINT OF VIEW, NEWS AGENCY REPORT EVERY DAY OF MISSING PERSONS,\nKILLINGS, AND TORTURES. ARE THE ONES EVERYONE KNOWS AS THE DEATH\nSQUADRONS INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITIES?\n\n   [ASTURIAS] INDEED, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION. WE\nCOULD SAY WITHOUT BEING MISTAKEN THAT THERE IS A TERRORIST ESCALATION\nHEADED BY STATE SECURITY FORCES. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DENOUNCE AND\nTO BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE THE ONES THAT ARE CARRYING OUT THIS\nREPRESSION AND THE ONES THAT ARE TAKING FORWARD THIS TERROR CAMPAIGN\nARE NOT PARAMILITARY GROUPS AS THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE AND\nTHEY ARE NOT EXTREME-RIGHT CIVILIAN GROUPS. THEY ARE ARMY OPERATIVE\nGROUPS THAT ACT BASED ON INFORMATION, CHARGES, SUSPICIONS, OR MANY\nTIMES BLINDLY TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION THEY CAN FIND, IN WHAT WAY THEY\nCAN HIT OR INFILTRATE THE PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.  WE ARE\nFACED WITH AN ESCALATION OF THE STRONGEST STATE TERRORISM.  IT CANNOT\nBE CONFUSED WITH DEATH SQUADRONS OR DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE RIGHT WING.\nTHE ARMY IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE OF THE REPRESSION.

[PASSAGE OMITTED]\n\n   [REPORTER] IS THE PARDON FOR MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS IN\nARGENTINA DAMAGING THE MORAL HEALTH OF YOUR COUNTRY OR ARGENTINA\nDEMOCRACY?\n\n   [MENEM] NO, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A PARDON HAS BEEN\nGRANTED IN THE WORLD.  THERE HAVE BEEN PARDONS EVERYWHERE.  NOT LONG\nAGO A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN URUGUAY AND IT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY THE\nURUGUAYAN PEOPLE.  A PARDON WAS GRANTED IN SPAIN AFTER THE [WORD\nINDISTINCT].  THERE WERE PARDONS GRANTED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR.\nPARDONS AND FORGETTING HAVE ALLOWED THE INTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN\nECONOMIC COMMUNITY.  IT ALSO ALLOWED PRESIDENT BUSH TO PAY HOMMAGE TO\nEMPEROR HIROITO, ONE OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECOND WORLD WAR,\nDURING HIS FUNERAL.  THEREFORE WE CAN COMPLETELY OVERCOME THIS MATTER.\n\n   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE OMITTED] REPORTED THAT ARGENTINA WOULD ASK TO\nPARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMIT MEETING OF THE PRESIDENTS OF COLOMBIA, PERU,\nAND BOLIVIA AND THE UNITED STATES.  IS THIS TRUE, AND WHAT WOULD BE\nTHE ARGENTINE ROLE IN THIS SUMMIT?\n\n   [MENEM] NO, THAT IS NOT CORRECT.  WE SUPPORT THIS SUMMIT MEETING,\nAND CONTINUE MAINTAINING OUR SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FIGHT AGAINST\nDRUG TRAFFICKING.  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN COCA\nPRODUCER AND COCA CONSUMER COUNTRIES.  THEY ARE BOTH PART OF A SAME\nPROCESS, SO WE MUST CARRY OUT AN ALL OUT WAR AGAINST THE THREE [AS\nHEARD] PHASES OF DRUG PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISING.\n\n   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] A STRONGER ACTION IS REQUIRED BY\n[WORD INDISTINCT] ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES TO FIGHT DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.\n\n   [MENEM] I THINK THAT WE NEED THE WILL OF EVERY ONE.  WE WOULD NOT\nGAIN ANYTHING BY RESTRICTING THE PRODUCTION OF COCA IN PERU, COLOMBIA,\nAND BOLIVIA IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HELP TO SUBSTITUTE THIS\nCROP.  WE CANNOT DIVIDE THIS ACTION.  THE FIGHT MUST BE AN ALL OUT WAR\nBY ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, BECAUSE DRUGS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT\nIN ALL COUNTRIES.  THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY THAT CAN CLAIM THAT\nTHERE IS NO DRUG ADDICITON OR TRAFFICKING IN ITS TERRITORY.  NOT LONG\nAGO, I READ THAT 14 DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE HANGED IN SAUDI ARABIA,\nWHERE THEY ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND WHERE THERE IS STRICT CONTROL\nOVER ANY KIND OF VICE.\n\n   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] WHAT POSITION HAS ARGENTINA\nMAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THIS MEETING REGARDING THE FOREIGN DEBT ISSUE?\nDO YOU THINK ALL THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBERS WILL ARRIVE TO A JOINT\nPOSITION REGARDING THIS ISSUE?\n\n   [MENEM] WE ARE CURRENTLY RENEGOTIATING OUR DEBTS INDIVIDUALLY\nBECAUSE EACH COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT. THE ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE SO FAR\nNOT BEEN INTEGRATED BUT THEY MUST BE INTEGRATED. AS LONG AS WE DO NOT\nATTAIN INTEGRATION, THE FOREIGN DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT\nINDIVIDUALLY.  IF WE MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS INTEGRATION, THINGS MAY\nCHANGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL.

HAS THIS BEEN\nDISCUSSED BY THE PRESIDENTS? WILL CONCRETE GOALS BE FIXED?\n\n   [MENEM] WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS. WE HAVE ALREADY SET CONCRETE GOALS,\nBASED ON EXPERIENCES. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH\nBRAZIL, WHICH URUGUAY RECENTLY JOINED. THIS MUST SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE\nFOR THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. OF COURSE WE MUST NOT\nFORGET SOME OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS, LIKE IN THE CASE OF THE ANDEAN\nPACT WHICH IS REVIVING AND REORGANIZING ITSELF, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS\nNOT ONLY IN LATIN AMERICA BUT IN THE WHOLE AMERICAN CONTINENT. WE ARE\nHEADING TOWARD A CONTINENTAL UNITY LIKE THAT OF CANADA AND THE UNITED\nSTATES. AFTER LATIN AMERICA ACHIEVES INTEGRATION WE WANT INTEGRATION\nWITH CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AMERICA.

IS IT\nBECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS PREVAILING IN EACH COUNTRY?\n\n   [GARCIA] WE HAVE A COMMON STANCE.  NO COUNTRY CAN PAY WHAT IT IS\nBEING ASKED TO PAY.  WE ALL KNOW THIS.  PEOPLE KNOW IT.  THE LABOR\nUNIONS KNOW IT.  THEREFORE, THAT IS OUR STANCE.\n\n   A FEW YEARS AGO SOME COUNTRIES MADE AN EFFORT TO PAY.  NOWADAY,\nEVERYBODY KNOWS THEY CANNOT PAY AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO CHANGE THE\nPAYMENT CONDITIONS.  THIS IS THE BASIC ISSUE THAT WE ALL SHARE.\n\n   THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTRIES RESORT TO THE BRADY PLAN, THAT OTHERS\nSEEK OTHER ALTERNATIVES, OR THAT OTHERS CHOOSE NOT TO PAY A DEBT THAT\nTHEY CONSIDER TO BE UNFAIR -- AT LEAT UNTIL CONDITIONS CHANGE OR\nPAYMENTS ARE REDUCED -- ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT SHADES OF A COMMON\nSTANCE.  THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE ARE GRADUALLY VERIFYING THAT\nNO COUNTRY IS ABLE TO PAY THE DEBT IN CONTRACTED, A DEBT THAT HAS\nGROWN ONLY BECAUSE OF INTERESTS.\n\n   I WILL REITERATE SOME DRAMATIC BUT REALISTIC FIGURES: 10 YEARS AGO\nLATIN AMERICA OWED $190 BILLION.  IT PAID $289 BILLION TO DECEMBER\n1988 -- THAT IS 10 YEARS -- AND IT STILL OWES $430 BILLION.  IN THE\nPAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA HAS REDUCED ITS PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION\nDRAMATICALLY BY 2 TO 3 PERCENT A YEAR.  IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN\nAMERICA REDUCED ITS IMPORTS, SEEKING TO SPEND LESS DOLLARS.  IT\nINCREASED ITS EXPORTS AND DEVALUED ITS CURRENCIES TO OBTAIN DOLLARS\nWITH WHICH TO PAY THE DEBT.\n\n   IN THE PAST 10 YEARS LATIN AMERICA GREW ONLY 1 PERCENT PER YEAR,\nAND IT HAS USED THAT 1 PERCENT, PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 4-PERCENT OF ITS\nGNP, TO PAY THE DEBT.\n\n   THEREFORE, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 10 YEARS LATER WE FIND THAT WE\nOWE MORE, PRODUCE LESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY OUR DEBT.  WE ALL\nKNOW THIS.  IT HAS COST US 10 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND IT.  HOWEVER IT IS\nAN EXPERIENCE THAT CONSTITUTES THE BASE FOR OUR COMMON STANCE.\n\n   [REPORTER] HAS PROGRESS BEEN MADE IN THIS FIELD SINCE THE PUNTA DEL\nESTE SUMMIT?\n\n   [GARCIA] WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN A BRADY PLAN IF WE HAD NOT MET IN\nACAPULCO OR IN PUNTA DEL ESTE?  ONE OF JAMES BRADY'S ADVISERS\nPUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES STATING THAT THE BRADY PLAN\nWAS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER 1985 TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE\nPERUVIAN ATTITUDE OF UNILATERALLY REDUCING ITS DEBT PAYMENTS.\n\n   WHO KNOWS IF THE ACAPULCO AND PUNTA DEL ESTE MEETINGS HAVE NOT LED\nTHE CREDITORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEBT IS NOT WORTH ITS FACE VALUE\nAND THAT IT MUST BE REDUCED?\n\n   THEREFORE, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  WHO KNOWS IF NEXT YEAR WE WILL\nBE SPEAKING OF REDUCING THE DEBT BY 50 PERCENT AND NOT JUST THE 20\nPERCENT THAT WE NOW SEEK?\n\n   YOU SEE, THE FACT IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE UNABLE TO PAY AND THAT WE\nARE NEGOTIATING TO PAY LESS, BUT THE CREDITORS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY\nWILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR MONEY IF THEY INSIST ON THEIR\nCLAIMS.\n\n   THEREFORE, IF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE HEADING TO\nWARD DISARMAMENT, WHY CAN'T THERE BE A FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT BETWEEN\nTHE RICH AND POOR?  I THINK THAT ECONOMIC TRENDS WILL FOLLOW THIS\nLINE.\n\n   [REPORTER] PRESIDENT, WHY HASN'T PANAMA BEEN DEFINITIVELY EXPELLED\nFROM THIS GROUP, AND WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?\n\n   [GARCIA] PANAMA AS A COUNTRY, INDEPENDENT OF ITS PAST\nADMINISTRATIONS, WAS A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT.  NO\nCOUNTRY CAN BE EXPELLED.  THIS IS A TERM THAT WOULD OFFEND THE\nCITIZENRY OF A COUNTRY.  WE SIMPLY RATIFIED THE SUSPENSION OF PANAMA\nINDEFINITELY UNTIL PANAMA IS GOVERNED BY A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED\nGOVERNMENT.  THAT WAS OUR DECISION.\n\n   [REPORTER] [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] THE OAS?\n\n   [GARCIA] WE ARE PREPARING A PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE STATE THAT THE OAS\nIS AN IMPORTANT FORUM OR MECHANISM FOR HEMISPHERIC DIALOGUE BUT WHICH\nMUST INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF CUBA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE YET\nNOT MEMBERS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WILL THE GROUP OF EIGHT EXPAND?\n\n   [GARCIA] I HOPE SO.  THIS IS THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH I WILL ATTEND A\nMEETING OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH I HELPED TO CREATE.  HOWEVER, I\nHOPE THIS GROUP WILL LEAD ANNUAL AND PERIODICAL MEETINGS OF ALL LATIN\nAMERICA PRESIDENTS.  I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS HOPE SINCE 1985.  I HOPE\nTHAT LATIN AMERICA WILL ANNUALLY COORDINATE SOME KIND OF COLLEGIAL\nEXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS.  THE GROUP OF EIGHT IS\nTHE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND I AM SURE THAT IT WILL EXPAND IN THE\nFUTURE.\n\n   HOWEVER, AT A CONTINENTAL LEVEL, THE ISSUES CANNOT RUN AS FAST AS\nFOR A COUNTRY, A PEOPLE, OR A POLITICAL PROCESS.  A CONTINENT REQUIRES\nMUCH LONGER TERMS AND WE MUST BE PATIENT.  LET US GO TO ANOTHER\nSUBJECT NOW.\n\n   [REPORTER] HUMAN RIGHTS.  TWO OF THE MAIN ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICAN\nLIFE ARE DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  PRESIDENT MENEM HAS\nRECENTLY PARDONED MILITARY OFFICERS AND TERRORISTS WHO WERE SERVING\nPRISON SENTENCES.  THERE IS ALSO A CONFLICTIVE SITUATION IN PERU\nREGARDING SOME MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING TRIED FOR MURDERS\nCOMMITTED IN JAILS.  ARE YOU WILLING TO PARDON THOSE MILITARY OFFICERS\nTO PACIFY THE SITUATION?  THIS IS MY FIRST QUESTION.\n\n   SECOND, THE PERUVIAN IMAGE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IS VERY\nBAD BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INFORMATION.  IN CONTRAST WITH ACAPULCO AND\nPUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH ARE HOLIDAY RESORTS WITH MULTIMILLION DOLLAR\nINFRASTRUCTURES, THE CITY OF ICA REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF LATIN\nAMERICAN CITIES.

HE\nMADE AN APPEAL TO ORGANIZE A WORLD FRONT TO ELIMINATE THIS SCOURGE.\n\n   BORJA CONFIRMED MITTERRAND'S STATEMENTS AND ADDED THAT ALTHOUGH\nECUADOR \"IS NOT A DRUG-PRODUCING COUNTRY, WE WILL NOT REST,\" BECAUSE I\nBELIEVE OTHER COUNTRIES \"BEGAN LATE\" IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS\nEVIL.\n\n   THE TWO PRESIDENTS AGREED ON THE NEED TO CONCERTED EFFORTS -- AMONG\nCOUNTRIES PRODUCING AND CONSUMING DRUGS, COUNTRIES USED FOR THE\nTRANSSHIPMENT OF DRUGS, AND FOR MONEY LAUNDERING -- TO FACE THIS\nSCOURGE.

OCT 89 (RADIO MAGALLANES) -- [COMMENTARY]\n[CHILEAN JOURNALIST ROLANDO CARRASCO] [TEXT] WE HAD BEEN LEFT\nCOMPLETELY ALONE AND ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT\nHAD BEEN OVERTHROWN, THE DICTATORSHIP HAD SCATTERED CONCENTRATION\nCAMPS AND ANONYMOUS DEAD AROUND THE COUNTRY, CONGRESS WAS CLOSED, ALL\nLEFTIST COMMUNICATION MEDIA WERE ALSO CLOSED, AND THE IMAGE OF THE\nDICTATORSHIP MONOPOLIZED THE TELEVISION SCREENS.  PINOCHET NEEDED TO\nBE LEFT ALONE IN ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER BY MURDERING HIS\nOPPONENTS.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE SENT MISSIONS ABROAD TO SEEK\nRECOGNITION AND SUPPORT.\n\n   IN THE FIRST DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COUP, RADIO MOSCOW BEGAN TO\nBEAM PROGRAMS TO CHILE, AND I AM NOW TALKING TO YOU FROM ITS STUDIOS.\nVOLODIA TEITELBOIM, CURRENT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST\nPARTY, WAS BY CHANCE IN MOSCOW IN SEPTEMBER 1973, AND IT FELL TO HIM\nTO INITIATE THE PROGRAMS \"LISTEN, CHILE\" [ESCUCHA, CHILE] AND RADIO\nMAGALLANES OVER THE MICROPHONES OF RADIO MOSCOW.  THE AUDIENCE OF\nTHESE PROGRAMS SUDDENLY GREW INSIDE CHILE.\n\n   AT FIRST, THE PROGRAMS DENOUNCED THE ARBITRARY ACTION OF THE\nMILITARY REGIME.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SMUGGLE NEWS OUT OF CHILE SO\nTHAT IT COULD BE BROADCAST ALL OVER CHILE BY RADIO MOSCOW, BUT NEWS OF\nTHE WORLD'S SOLIDARITY WAS BROADCAST NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TO CHILE.\nTHUS, THE WALL OF SILENCE THE DICTATOR INTENDED TO RAISE AROUND HIM TO\nHIDE HIS CRIMES WAS CRACKED.\n\n   A TRADITION OF LISTENING RADIO MOSCOW PROGRAMS TO LATIN AMERICA WAS\nDEVELOPED IN CHILE AS ATTESTED BY THE MAIL THAT REACHED ITS STUDIOS.\nTHE BULK OF MAIL FROM CHILE CONFIRMS THIS.  SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT\nTHE MOSCOW TRANSMISSIONS WERE HELPING THE CAUSE OF THE PERSECUTED, THE\nWORKERS, THE STUDENTS, THE PRISONERS, THE MUZZLED DEMOCRATS, AND THE\nGRIEVING WIDOWS OF CHILE.  THROUGH THESE TRANSMISSIONS, THOSE PEOPLE\nRECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AN ENCOURAGEMENT SENT BY THE PEOPLES\nOF THE WORLD.\n\n   THE FIRST BROADCASTS WERE MADE IN THOSE YEARS, AND VERY FEW HAVE\nNOT LISTENED TO THEM AT SOME TIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY ADMITTED TO\nKNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PROGRAMS.  THE TYRANT HIMSELF VIOLENTLY ATTACKED\nTHE PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC SPEECHES.  NOT LONG AGO, PINOCHET'S\nFOREIGN MINISTER AGAIN SCATHINGLY REFERRED TO RADIO MOSCOW'S\nBROADCASTS.  THAT IS TO SAY THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CONTINUED TO\nAFFECT THE DICTATORSHIP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT THEY HAVE\nHELPED THE RESURGENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES.  THE RESURGENCE AND\nORGANIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES THROUGH THE IMPETUS OF THE\nWORKERS AND BROAD SECTORS OF THE POPULATION HAVE RESHAPED THE CHILEAN\nPOLITICAL SITUATION, TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE REAL\nPOSSIBILITY OF AN ELECTORAL TRIUMPH BY A SINGLE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE\nTO THE PRESIDENCY, THUS SETTING THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION IN MOTION.\n\n   IN FACT THE SITUATION NOT ONLY HAS CHANGED IN CHILE, BUT ALSO IN\nTHE SOVIET UNION WHERE THE PERESTROYKA -- A REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS\nINSIDE A REVOLUTION -- HAS OPENED IMMENSE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE\nECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET SOCIETY.  WE\nFREQUENTLY KEEP YOU ABREAST OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS OF\nRADIO MOSCOW.  SO, ALL THIS HAS GALVANIZED OUR DISPOSITION TO CONTINUE\nCOOPERATING IN THIS PROCES THAT HAS REACHED NEW LEVELS.\n\n   OUR PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE OPEN AND AT THE DISPOSAL OF ALL ADVANCE\nFORCES THAT MARCH WITH THE DEMOCRATS.  A FEW WEEKS AGO, RADIO MOSCOW\nCOMPLETED 16 YEARS OF BROADCAST TO CHILE.  NOW, ON 29 OCTOBER RADIO\nMOSCOW WILL CELEBRATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY.  ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE\nWORLD KNOW THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW IN 81 LANGUAGES.  THE PROGRAMS\nTO CHILE HAVE A PRIVILEGED PLACE AMONG THEM.  FOR THE OCCASION,\nGREETINGS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE PROGRAMS OF RADIO MOSCOW AND RADIO\nMAGALLANES.  FROM CHILEANS SCATTERED IN 40 COUNTRIES BY THE FASCIST\nEXPLOSION, RADIO MOSCOW ALSO RECEIVES MAIL AND POSTCARD WITH MESSAGES\nOF APPRECIATION AND THANKS.  THIS IS A MODEST WAY OF RESPONDING TO THE\nVALUABLE ASSISTANCE RADIO MOSCOW HAS GIVEN, IS GIVING, AND WILL\nCONTINUE TO GIVE US.\n\n   WE HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE, ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD, AND RADIO MOSCOW\nPROVED TO BE OUR FRIEND DURING SHAMEFUL TIMES.

LOGICALLY, I CANNOT SAY THAT THEIR'S IS A\nSERIOUS POSITION BECAUSE WHEN A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS ARE PUT FORWARD, A\nPERIOD OF TIME IS REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE FMLN\nIMMEDIATELY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT IT WOULD\nNOT ACCEPT IT.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?  THAT THE FMLN NO LONGER WANTS TO\nTALK ABOUT THE END OF THE HOSTILITIES, BUT WANTS TO INTRODUCE NEW\nTOPICS AT THE SAN JOSE MEETING.\n\n   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FMLN'S POSITION, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT\nBEEN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS, ONE CAN SEE AT FIRST\nGLANCE THAT THE PROPOSALS THEY HAVE PUT FORWARD ARE TOTALLY ABSURD.  I\nWILL CITE AN EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE FMLN HAS ADMITTED TO\nBEING UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITION, THAT IF IT ATTEMPTS TO OCCUPY A\nTOWN, IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS THE ARMED FORCES DRIVE IT OUT.  IT CANNOT\nMAINTAIN A POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN PROPOSAL\nATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIAL LIMITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n   WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE FMLN EXISTS AND IS A REALITY, I BELIEVE\nTHAT REALITY HAS A DIMENSION, A SIZE.  THE RESULTS OF THE PAST\nELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING OVER 3 PERCENT [WON BY THE\nDEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE], INDICATE THAT THE FMLN IS A REALITY BUT A\nVERY SMALL ONE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE A\nGOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.\n\n   MEANWHILE, THE FMLN HAS COME UP WITH THE TOTALLY ABSURD NOTION THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT MUST DISMISS THE ENTIRE [MILITARY] CLASS OF '66, THE\nDEFENSE MINISTER, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FORCE.

IT IS SEEKING TO ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE\nREPUBLIC.  IT WANTS TO [DISCREDIT] THE GOVERNMENT IMAGE, WHICH HAS\nBEEN CONSOLIDATED LITTLE BY LITTLE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, BECAUSE\nWE ARE SHOWING TO THE WORLD THAT THERE IS A DEMOCRACY HERE, THAT A\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS BEING CONSOLIDATED, AND THAT THE FORCES THAT\nALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM ARE FORCES THAT TRULY WANT\nAND SEEK PEACE, RATHER THAN FORCES THAT ASSASSINATE AND CAUSE\nDESTRUCTION.  THEREFORE, WE CAN NO LONGER THINK AT THIS MOMENT, THAT\nTHE FMLN HAS ONLY VIEWED THE DIALOGUE FROM A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW.\n\n   HOWEVER, WE WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.  ALL THIS STRATEGY SHOULD NOT\nCONFUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE MUST BE CALM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT\nOF THE REPUBLIC WILL NOT GIVE AN INCH AND WILL CONTINUE, THROUGH\nRATIONAL MEANS, TO STRUGGLE AND SEARCH FOR PEACE, TO WHICH YOU AND ALL\nSALVADORANS ARE ENTITLED.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THE TRAPS THE\nFMLN IS TRYING TO PUT BEFORE US.  HOWEVER, AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT WE\nSHOULD SEE IS WHO WANTS PEACE AND WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEARCH FOR\nPEACE.  UP TO THIS MOMENT, THE FMLN HAS GIVEN NO EVIDENCE IT WANTS TO\nATTAIN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY FOR YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, WE MUST NOT BE PESSIMISTIC.  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT\nONE CANNOT SAY, FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES, THAT OUTSTANDING RESULTS WERE\nOBTAINED AT THE MEETING IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, SOME RESULTS WERE\nATTAINED.  THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE AND THAT SHOULD\nELIMINATE ALL TRACES OF PESSIMISM.  WE MUST THINK THAT THE DIALOGUE\nPROCESS THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO WAS NOT BROKEN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA,\nAND THAT THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE NEXT MONTH IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA.\nTHE ISSUE AGAIN WILL BE CEASING HOSTILITIES.  WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND\nMORE AWARE OF THE VARIOUS POSITIONS, AND THERE IS LESS ROOM TO PLAY\nSTRATEGIC GAMES WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY SUBJECT IN THIS\nDIALOGUE PROCESS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.\nWHEN WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, SUCH AGREEMENTS MUST BE RESPECTED.  THAT\nIS THE ATTITUDE THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IF THERE IS A TRUE POLITICAL\nDESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  THEREFORE, ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY\nMESSAGE BY MAKING AN APPEAL FOR UNITY.  WE MUST BE UNITED FOR PEACE.\nALL SECTORS -- POLITICAL, LABOR, RELIGIOUS, AND BUSINESS -- MUST\nDEMAND THAT THE FMLN SHOW A TRUE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE PEACE.  WE MUST\nDEMAND THAT THE FMLN STOP TRYING TO USE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR FOR\nSTRATEGIC PURPOSES.  IF THE FMLN TRULY WANTS PEACE, WHY DOES IT\nCONTINUE TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS -- PROBABLY\n FROM NICARAGUA -- INTO EL SALVADOR.  TODAY, A TRUCK FROM NICARAGUA\nLOADED WITH WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES FOR THE FMLN WAS CONFISCATED AT THE\nBORDER WITH HONDURAS.  THIS SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS NOT YET SERIOUSLY\nSEARCHING FOR PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE UNITY OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD FORCE THE FMLN TO SEARCH FOR PEACE.  THE\nUNITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD CLOSE POLITICAL SPACE SO THE\n[FMLN] WILL STOP ITS STRATEGIC GAMES.  ALL OF US, UNITED, SHOULD\nDEMAND THAT THE FMLN TAKE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS SERIOUSLY, EQUALLY AS\nSERIOUSLY AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE MUST\nSEARCH THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS TO HAVE PEACE AND CALM IN EL SALVADOR.\n\n   SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US NOT DISMAY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT\nWE SHOULD NOT HAVE EXCESSIVE ENTHUSIASM.  THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM,\nTHERE WILL BE OBSTACLES, IT IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE\nALWAYS SAID YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR PEACE\nAND WILL NOT CEASE TO WORK FOR PEACE.\n\n   MAY GOD BLESS YOU.  GOOD EVENING.
