ANALYST ALEKSEY PAVLOV DISCUSSES THIS\nSUBJECT:\n\n   FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ISSUES, THIS NEWS\nIS NO SURPRISE. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS AS WELL AS THE RESUMPTION OF\nTHE WAR, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION WAS PRESSURED BY CERTAIN U.S.\nCIRCLES TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.\n\n   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MEDIA ARE CONDUCTING A CRUSADE TO CONVINCE\nTHE PUBLIC THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND CERTAINLY THE USSR, ARE PROVIDING\nWEAPONS TO THE [WORD INDISTINCT] REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE UNITED STATES\nCERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS\nPRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL\nPRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA.\n\n   APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN\nORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT.  THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE\nWITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE\nCONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS\nUNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT.\n\n   THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH\nNICARAGUA AS A MASK.  HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS,\nINCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS\nAND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT\nCONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE\nTHAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.  THE\nCRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS\nWHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY.\n\n   IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE\nBREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN\nSAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE\nDEATH SQUADS.  IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE?  OF COURSE NOT.  MOST\nPROBABLY THESE DEATH SQUADS RECEIVED ORDERS TO MAKE SUCH THREATS WITH\nA VIEW TOWARD THE DIPLOMATIC BREAK.\n\n   BY WHAT CAN BE SEEN, THE ACTION OF DEATH SQUADS IS COMMON PRACTICE\nFOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THIS DIPLOMATIC BREAK IS A\nSERIOUS ACT FOR WHICH CRISTIANI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE.  HONDURAN\nPRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO CONSIDERS THIS ACTION A GREAT DANGER TO\nPEACE IN THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS AN UNQUESTIONABLE FACT.

IN VIEW OF A POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF THE SALVADORAN\nCONFLICT, IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES\nWERE THE FIRST ONES TO ESCALATE THE WAR BY LAUNCHING INDISCRIMINATE\nATTACKS AND AIR BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN DENSELY\nPOPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAD BEEN DOING\nTHIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS.  IN VIEW OF THE\nDAMAGE THAT THIS CAUSES THE POPULATION, SINCE 1987 THE FMLN HAS MADE\nPROPOSALS TO SCALE DOWN THE WAR AND SUSPEND THE USE OF AIRCRAFT AND\nAVIATION EQUIPMENT.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE HYPOCRITICAL, AS THE\nGOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS TURNED AIRCRAFT INTO REAL INSTRUMENTS OF\nGENOCIDE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\n\n   2.  THE POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS TURNED\nCENTRAL AMERICA INTO A HUGE ARMS MARKET WHEREBY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF\nSOVIET AND U.S. WEAPONS, INCLUDING SURFACE-TO AIR MISSILES, HAVE BEEN\nINTRODUCED INTO THE AREA.  THIS HAS CREATED A FLOURISHING BLACK MARKET\nFOR WEAPONS, WHERE SALVADORAN AND HONDURAN MILITARY MEN AND NICARAGUAN\nCONTRAS PARTICIPATE AS BIG-TIME SMUGGLERS.\n\n   3.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN OF ACCUSATIONS\nAGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF PUTTING UP A\nSMOKE SCREEN TO COVER THE GENOCIDE IT HAS UNLEASHED AND TO DIVERT THE\nATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMANDING:\n\n       A) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT STOP THE MASSIVE AND\nINDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AND THE\nPERSECUTION AGAINST THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND GRASS ROOTS\nMOVEMENTS;\n\n       B) AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR UP THE MURDER OF SIX JESUIT\nPRIESTS AND TWO DOMESTIC WORKERS, ALONG WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THESE AND SIMILAR CRIMES; AND,\n\n       C) THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPT THE CEASE-FIRE IT HAS\nHERETOFORE REJECTED AND JUSTIFY ITS INTRANSIGENT AND IRRATIONAL\nPOSITION.\n\n   4.  CRISTIANI'S DECISION TO SUSPEND RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA BASED\nON AN ALLEGED SHIPMENT OF MISSILES FOR THE FMLN IS NOT REASONABLE, NOT\nEVEN BY SAYING THAT THIS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE SALVADORAN\nWAR.  IN FACT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ESCALATED THE WAR BY SENDING $4\nBILLION IN AID TO STRENGTHEN THE ARMY AND PROVIDE IT WITH A POWERFUL\nAIR FORCE.\n\n   THE JUSTIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT TO THE FMLN,\nTHUS REFUSING TO ADMIT THE INTERNAL CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT AND ALSO\nKEEPING THE DOORS CLOSED TO ANY NEGOTIATIONS.  THIS HAS\nUNNECESSARILY PROLONGED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S SUFFERING AND HAS       \nMADE MORE DRAMATIC THEIR LEGITIMATE STRUGGLE FOR A TRUE DEMOCRATIC,\nPLURALIST, AND NON-ALIGNED GOVERNMENT.\n\n   BASED ON THE ABOVE, WE REITERATE:\n\n   1.  THAT WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN ALL\nTYPES OF WEAPONS TO GUARANTEE OUR DEFENSE AND TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE\nFROM THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MILITARY ESCALATION PROMOTED BY THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE FIRM SUPPORT OF THE PREVIOUS AND\nPRESENT U.S. GOVERNMENTS.  THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN WEAPONS\nFROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND TO GUARANTEE THEIR ARRIVAL AT OUR WAR FRONTS\nTHROUGH ANY MEANS AVAILABLE.\n\n   2.  WE MAINTAIN OUR TOTAL WILLINGNESS TO DE-ESCALATE THE WAR.  WE\nBEGIN BY EXPRESSING THAT WE ARE TOTALLY WILLING TO AGREE ON A\nCEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND TO BEGIN REAL\nNEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THE NATION'S\nPOLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES.\n\n   3.

ON\nBEHALF OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER IMMEDIATELY\nEXPRESSED THE DISADVANTAGES OF APPROVING THAT PROPOSAL.\n\n   I HAVE CONSULTED WITH FORMER PRESIDENTS ALBERTO LLERAS, CARLOS\nLLERAS RESTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ, AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY ABOUT INCLUDING\nTHE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM, AND THEY FEEL THAT WITH THE\nCURRENT PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS\nBEEN DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,\nIT WOULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO USE THE REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON\nEXTRADITION.\n\n   THE COUNTRY MUST NOT DECEIVE ITSELF AS TO WHERE WE WOULD BE HEADED\nIF WE HELD A REFERENDUM ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, AND AS TO THE\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION ON THE COUNTRY'S MORALE AND ON\nDEMOCRACY'S SURVIVAL.\n\n   INITIALLY, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXTRADITING COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS\nFOR THEM TO STAND TRIAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OF EXTRADITING DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD.  EXTRADITION IS NOT\nPUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nNEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO\nPORTRAY IT.\n\n   EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL\nTREATIES.  THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE\nEXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE\nCONSTITUTION.  CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING\nPUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT\nPROVISIONS.  THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS\nIMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY\nAPPROVED.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL\nPREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT\nCOLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED\nTHROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH\nDIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY\nINFORMING THE COUNTERPART.\n\n   FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF\nCRIMINALS.  I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN\nEXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO\nITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY.  PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES\nOF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO\nEXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH\nAS DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED\nTO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH\nTHE NECESSARY LAWS.  THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT\nAGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS.  IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE\nCRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD.  SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID\nTHAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS\nELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR.  NEITHER IS TRUE.\n\n   THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED\nPRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY.  AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO\nEFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE\nMINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT\nDECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nAFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL\nCARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS\nKIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO\nLEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.

THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR\nANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN\nQUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN\nEXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT.  LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nBROUGHT US VIOLENCE.  A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK,\nFROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE.  LET\nUS NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY\nMURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND\nINTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT\nEXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE\nTRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nHOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH\nOFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE\nMURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL\nOFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO\nWANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME.  HOW THEN CAN WE\nBELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS?  CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nCAUSED THIS VIOLENCE?  CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH\nTHESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS?\n\n   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT\nHARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM.  WE KNOW\nTHAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE\nDONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.  WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS.  MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE\nSIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL\nCAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION?  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE\nAGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION?  IT\nWOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS' MONEY.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT\nWOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.  A\nREFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION\nON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST.  TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE\nREFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC\nOPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD.\n\n   CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED\nFREELY.  I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK\nINTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL\nINTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS.  I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST\nREFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO\nSERVE SELFISH INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN\nIMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS.  THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER\nPARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE\nWITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT\nDRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.  I WANT TO SAY THAT\nELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND\nMORE VIOLENCE.  THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT\nALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE\nPUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC\nTHAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE\nDANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL\nINVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.

THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO;\nWITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH\nINDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE\nGOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES.  THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE\nPICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE\nNATIONAL RESOLVE TO OVERCOME THEM.

WE MUST BE\nAWARE THAT THE WORLD IS HEADING TOWARD INTEGRATION AND THAT IT IS MORE\nCONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US TO ATTAIN THE BEST AND MOST INTEGRATED\nRELATIONS POSSIBLE.  WE MUST SEEK SOLUTIONS AND, AS THE BOLIVIAN\nPRESIDENT RECENTLY STATED, WE MUST SEEK IMAGINATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH A\n21ST CENTURY AND NOT A 19TH CENTURY VIEW.  I HOPE THAT WITHIN THIS\nSPIRIT WE WILL MANAGE NOT ONLY TO REESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH BOLIVIA,\nBUT TO ESTABLISH SATISFACTORY RELATIONS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES.\n\n   [SOLA] CHILEAN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN\nEXCELLENT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE MURDER OF ORLANDO LETELIER\nIS TIED INTO THIS SITUATION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT,\nCONSIDERING THAT A U.S. COURT HAS REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF GENERAL\nCONTRERAS AND COLONEL ESPINOZA?\n\n   [AYLWIN] WELL, I HOPE THAT CHILE WILL MAINTAIN THE BEST RELATIONS\nPOSSIBLE WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED\nSTATES, A COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE ARE LINKED FOR MANY REASONS.  I\nDISCUSSED THIS SUBJECT WITH PEOPLE FROM U.S. DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL,\nAND ECONOMIC CIRCLES, AND I HAVE NOTED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE\nRELATIONS AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATING US AS\nSOON AS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS REESTABLISHED.\n\n   I DO NOT THINK THAT AN EXTRADITION WILL SOLVE THE LETELIER CASE\nBECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED ON BY THE SUPREME COURT.  IT IS WHAT\nWE LAWYERS REFER TO AS AN ADJUDGED MATTER.  I THINK THAT CHILE CAN\nDEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO HELP CLARIFY THE CASE AND GUARANTEE\nJUSTICE, AS IT IS OUR [WORD INDISTINCT] PURPOSE IN ALL HUMAN RIGHTS\nPROBLEMS, SO AS TO SATISFY THE MOST DEMANDING CONSCIENCES OF THE\nWORLD.

HE SAID THAT THE\nRESULTS OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED 15 DAYS AGO ARE POSITIVE.  THE PRESIDENT\nCALLED ON ALL BUSINESSMEN AND INDUSTRIALISTS NOT TO SPECULATE ON PRICES.  HE\nALSO REITERATED HIS SUPPORT FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE MINISTER CESAR VASQUEZ\nBAZAN, WHO HE SAID IS MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO FACE THE PERUVIAN ECONOMIC\nSITUATION.  GARCIA MADE THESE STATEMENTS AFTER A MEETING WITH THE COUNCIL OF\nMINISTERS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] THE BORDER CLOSURE\nMEASURE EXPIRES TODAY.  WILL IT BE EXTENDED?\n\n   [GARCIA] NO, THE BORDERS WERE NEVER CLOSED.  WE ONLY ESTABLISHED\nSOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF TRANSIT PERMITS IN TACNA TO PREVENT AN\nINCREASE OF SMUGGLING BEFORE THE YEAR-END FESTIVITIES.  THE 15-DAY\nTERM OF THAT MEASURE HAS EXPIRED, AND IT WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\n\n   [REPORTER] APPARENTLY, THAT MEASURE HAS NOT HAD GOOD RESULTS.\n\n   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IT HAS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS\nBECAUSE SMUGGLING HAS PROBABLY DECREASED SOMEWHAT.  AS YOU KNOW, A FEW\nYEARS AGO CHILE ESTABLISHED THE IQUIQUE FREE ZONE WHERE PRODUCTS ARE\nSOLD TO PERU AND BOLIVIA.  THUS A STABLE MARKET OF HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHICH DAILY PASS THOROUGH THE TACNA BORDER WITH\nSMALL PACKAGES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.\n\n   WE SIMPLY RESTRICTED THE PERMITS THEY USE TO BRING IN A TAPE\nRECORDER OR LASER DISC PLAYERS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT SMUGGLING DECREASED\nFOR A FEW DAYS.  HOWEVER, THAT MERCHANDISE ENTERED THE COUNTRY BY\nOTHER MEANS.  WE CANNOT IMPOSE TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE CAN ASK\nTHE CUSTOMS OFFICE AND THE POLICE TO INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTROL\nEXCESSIVE SMUGGLING INTO THE COUNTRY.\n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR WILL DROP BY\nJANUARY?\n\n   [GARCIA] I AM SURE IT WILL.  LAST YEAR, LIKE NOW, THE FREE- MARKET\nDOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE INCREASED SHARPLY BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE PAYING\nYEAR-END BONUSES AND THEY ARE CONVERTING THEIR PROFITS INTO DOLLARS.\nPEOPLE ARE TAKING HOLIDAY TRIPS AND BUYING MORE GOODS AND HOME\nAPPLIANCES.  THEREFORE, THE DOLLAR DEMAND AND PRICES HAVE INCREASED.\n\n   LAST YEAR, WHEN THE MUC [SINGLE EXCHANGE MARKET] DOLLAR\nEXCHANGE RATE WAS AT 500 INTIS TO A DOLLAR, THE FREE-MARKET DOLLAR\nCLIMBED TO 2,000 INTIS.  LATER IT DROPPED TO 1,000 INTIS IN JANUARY.\nI THINK THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR. [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n\n   [REPORTER] THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RUMORS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT\nTHE ECONOMY MINISTER IS ABOUT TO RESIGN OR IS BEING PRESSURED TO\nRESIGN.  IS THIS TRUE?\n\n   [GARCIA] THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD PRESSURE HIM IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nREPUBLIC, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT PRESSURING HIM.  WE ACKNOWLEDGE\nTHE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES OF THE PERUVIAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS OF\nTHE ECONOMY MINISTER.  I EXPRESS MY RECOGNITION OF AND SUPPORT FOR THE\nECONOMY MINISTER BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG, WELL-INTENTIONED, AND VERY HONEST; HE\nHAS PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.  HE IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE TO STABILIZE THE\nECONOMY AS WELL AS POSSIBLE, AND HE SPONSORED A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AFTER\nTHE ELECTIONS.\n\n   [REPORTER] TODAY DID THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS DISCUSS A WAGE\nINCREASE FOR THIS MONTH?\n\n   [GARCIA] THAT POINT MUST BE DEFINED BY THE ECONOMY AND LABOR\nMINISTERS.  TODAY, IN ADDITION TO THE BORDER ISSUE, WE DISCUSSED A\nSUBJECT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO.\n\n   ON THAT OCCASION I LISTENED TO A REPORT FROM THE SO-CALLED\nCOMMANDER HUAIHUACU.  HE IS CHIEF OF SOME 85 PEASANT COMMUNITIES ALONG\nTHE APURIMAC RIVER WHICH HAVE REBELLED AGAINST SHINING PATH CONTROL.\nTHE APURIMAC RIVER SEPARATES THE AYACUCHO AND CUSCO DEPARTMENTS, AND\nTHESE PEASANTS LIVE IN AN AREA CALLED OREJA DE PERRO IN LA MAR\nPROVINCE.  THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT A DEMOCRATIC UPRISING AND ORGANIZED\nTHEMSELVES TO KEEP SHINING PATH FROM ENTERING THEIR COMMUNITIES.\n\n   THIS SO-CALLED COMMANDER HUAIHUACU, WHO IS A MAN OF ACTION, HAS\nORGANIZED APPROXIMATELY 85 COMMUNITIES ON THE BANKS OF THE APURIMAC\nRIVER, IN AYACUCHO PROVINCE OF LA MAR AND THE CUSCO DISTRICT OF\nCHARATE.  HUAIHUACU HAS COME TO LIMA SEEKING SUPPORT.\n\n   WE HAVE DECIDED WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTRY TO GO TOMORROW TO\nRINCONADA BAJA AREA IN LA MAR PROVINCE, SHINING PATH'S PRIMARY AREA OF\nACTIVITY FOR 10 YEARS.  THERE I WILL DEDICATE A RADIO STATION TO BE\nCALLED RADIO DEMOCRACIA. ITS AIM WILL BE TO BROADCAST NEWS AND\nDEMOCRATIC AND PATRIOTIC MESSAGES FROM THAT AREA WHICH IS A CENTER OF\nPEASANT RESISTANCE AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n   WE WILL ARRIVE THERE TOMORROW AND TALK WITH THE PEASANT LEADERS WHO\nFOR YEARS HAVE FOUGHT SHINING PATH TOGETHER WITH OUR NAVY INFANTRY\nUNITS STATIONED IN LUISIANA AND SAN FRANCISCO.

THIS MORNING WE\nRECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE SANDINIST PEOPLE'S ARMY [EPS] HAD BOMBED AND\nSANK SEVERAL HONDURAN BOATS.  WE MEAN CIVILIAN FISHING BOATS.  I WILL\nTELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.\n\n   WE HAVE VERY FEW PATROL BOATS ON THE ATLANTIC COAST AND OUR BOATS\nTHERE ARE IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING NICARAGUA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WEALTH.\nFOR MANY YEARS, THE NICARAGUAN AIR FORCE AND THE SANDINIST NAVY HAVE\nBEEN CONDUCTING JOINT OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT THE\nFIRST TIME WE HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH OPERATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE\nTAPED MOST OF THOSE OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THOROUGH TRAINING\nAND ACCURACY.\n\n   DURING THOSE OPERATIONS, HELICOPTERS HAVE DEPLOYED MEN WHO BOARD\nMOST OF THE SHIPS PARTICIPATING IN THE OPERATIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nHELICOPTERS FOLLOW THE SHIPS AS THEY MOVE ALONG AND THEN SPECIAL\nSANDINIST NAVY FORCES BOARD THE SHIP FROM THE AIR.\n\n   I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED MORE OR LESS.  ON 7 DECEMBER 1989 WE\nCONDUCTED AN OPERATION, BASICALLY BECAUSE SINCE NOVEMBER, WE HAVE\nDETECTED OVER 30 PIRATE SHIPS, IN OTHER WORDS, SHIPS THAT HAVE NEITHER\nLICENSE NOR PERMIT TO FISH IN NICARAGUAN TERRITORIAL WATERS.\n\n   DURING AN OPERATION OF THE TYPE I JUST DESCRIBED, OUR FORCES\nBOARDED THREE BOATS AT 1020 ON 7 DECEMBER.  THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED\nOUT APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES EAST OF PUERTO CABEZAS.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHE THREE BOATS WERE BOARDED IN THIS AREA HERE.  [WHEELOCK APPARENTLY\nSHOWS LOCATION ON A MAP].\n\n   THE NAMES OF THE BOATS ARE \"KERRY MAC II\", \"DAVIS JR,\" \"MISS\nPATSY,\" AND ANOTHER ONE CALLED \"TIE WATER\" [NUMBER OF BOATS AS\nHEARD].  THE BOATS WERE CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ.  IN EACH\nBOAT THERE WERE FIVE NICARAGUAN SOLDIERS, ONE AIR FORCE OFFICER, AND\nONE NAVY OFFICER.  AS THE BOATS WERE TAKEN TO ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE\nMEMBERS OF THE \"MISS PATSY\" CREW, WHO NUMBERED APPROXIMATELY 60,\nMUTINIED AGAINST THE SANDINIST OFFICERS ON BOARD.\n\n   THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN AND A COOK DISARMED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS AND\nKILLED HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THE CONFRONTATION, THE COOK WAS KILLED,\nBUT THE CAPTAIN WAS UNHARMED.  AFTER THE MUTINY WAS OVER, AND AT\nAPPROXIMATELY 0.7 MILES FROM CORN, I MEAN ISLA DEL MAIZ, THE SHIP'S\nCAPTAIN RAN THE \"MISS PATSY\" FISHING BOAT AGROUND ON SOME REEF NEAR\nISLA DEL MAIZ GRANDE AND WE WERE FORCED TO, LET US SAY, SAVE ALL THE\nPEOPLE ON BOARD AND TAKE THEM TO CORN ISLAND.\n\n   ONE OF THE \"MISS PATSY\" SAILORS JUMPED OFF THE SHIP AND WE HAVE\nBEEN UNABLE TO FIND HIM.  OF THE TWO BODIES, THAT OF THE ARMY OFFICER\nAND THE COOK, WE HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE COOK'S BODY\nBECAUSE THE SHIP SANK.  MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO\nHOSPITALS IN BLUEFIELDS AND OTHERS ARE BEING HELD BY THE SANDINIST\nNAVY.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.\n\n   WHEN THE \"MISS PATSY\" RAN AGROUND, THE CREW MEMBERS OF THE OTHER\nSHIPS CAME TO HELP, AND DURING THIS TIME, APPARENTLY, THE SHIP CALLED\n\"DAVIS JR\" MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND IT, BUT WE\nWANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE FOLLOWING EPS OFFICERS ARE ON THAT BOAT: AIR\nFORCE FIRST LIEUTENANT VICTOR RODRIGUEZ HERNANDEZ, LT JUAN CARLOS GALO\nTINOCO, NAVY SAILOR JOSE MARCELINO REYES, AND SAILOR JOSE RENE\nRODRIGUEZ.\n\n   WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE \"DAVIS JR,\" BUT WE BELIEVE IT\nRETURNED TO HONDURAS.  THAT IS MORE OR LESS WHAT HAPPENED.  I AM NOW\nREADY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO ASK.

THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTS' MEETING HAS ALLOWED US TO\nMEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR AND THE IMPACT OF THE\nFMLN'S CURRENT MILITARY OFFENSIVE, INASMUCH AS THE SUMMIT'S ENTIRE\nEFFORT WAS AIMED AT SAVING THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT FROM AN EXTREME\nPOLITICAL AND MILITARY CRISIS AND FROM INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION IN\nEXCHANGE FOR A NEW PROMISE ON THE IMMEDIATE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE\nNICARAGUAN CONTRAS.\n\n   2.  THE FMLN INDIGNANTLY REJECTS THE PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION\nBECAUSE, CONTRARY TO THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL\nCOMMUNITY, THE CLAMOR OF DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL FORCES, AND THE CLAMOR\nOF CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, THIS DECLARATION UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORTS\nTHE LEADING VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION, A GOVERNMENT THAT\nHAS MURDERED AND PERSECUTED THE CLERGY AND BOMBED THE CIVILIAN\nPOPULATION. THIS SUPPORT ENCOURAGES THOSE WHO HAVE UNLEASHED THAT\nIRRATIONAL VIOLENCE AND ALLOWS MORE MURDERS IN EL SALVADOR.\n\n   3.  THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A NEGOTIATED\nSOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR. THE FMLN CANNOT BE DISBANDED AS THE RESULT OF\nAGREEMENTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THE FMLN CONSTITUTES A\nGENUINELY POPULAR POWER THROUGHOUT THE SALVADORAN TERRITORY, A FORCE\nTHAT THE HUGE U.S.-FINANCED WAR MACHINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP IN\n10 YEARS.\n\n   4. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID IN PRIVATE, THE FMLN AGREES WITH UN\nSECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ' MEDIATION TO INITIATE SERIOUS\nNEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL\nAND SOCIAL FORCES.\n\n   5. WE ARE HEREBY CALLING FOR INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY SO OTHER\nCOUNTRIES CAN MOBILIZE IMMEDIATELY TO DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE,\nWHO ARE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM AN ESCALATION IN EFFORTS TO\nEXTERMINATE IT BECAUSE THE FASCIST POLICY HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY THE\nSUPPORT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' DECLARATION OFFERS TO\nCRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT.\n\n   EL SALVADOR, 12 DECEMBER 1989.\n\n   FMLN GENERAL COMMAND\n\n   [SIGNED] COMMANDERS JOAQUIAN VILLALOBOS, FRANCISCO JOVEL, EDUARDO\nSANCHO, JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": " DEV-MUC3-0971 (SRI)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": " *", "INCIDENT: DATE": " *", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": " *", "INCIDENT: TYPE": " *", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": " *", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": " *", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": " *", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": " *", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": " *", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": " *", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": " *", "PHYS TGT: ID": " *", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": " *", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": " *", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": " *", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": " *", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": " *", "HUM TGT: NAME": " *", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": " *", "HUM TGT: TYPE": " *", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": " *", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": " *", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": " *", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": " *"}}, {"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE\nWITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR AND\nREPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [CRISTIANI] IN THE CASE OF EL SALVADOR,\nTHIS IS NOT A MATTER OF THE IRREGULAR GROUP BEING AROUND SAN SALVADOR,\nIN GUASAPA, OR IN CHALATENANGO -- WHEREVER THEY MAY WANT TO OPERATE.\nWE BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOBILIZATION PROCESS IS APPLICABLE IF THE GROUP\nCEASES TO BE AN IRREGULAR GROUP, SOMETHING THAT NO LONGER HAS ANY\nJUSTIFICATION, TO BECOME A POLITICAL OR A CIVIC GROUP IN THE FRAMEWORK\nOF A LEGAL PROCESS.\n\n   THE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT THE PRESIDENTS NO LONGER WANT OR JUSTIFY\nIRREGULAR GROUPS IN THE REGION, AND IRREGULAR GROUPS HAVE NO REASON\nFOR CONTINUING IN THE REGION.  THIS INCLUDES THE NICARAGUAN\nRESISTANCE, THE FMLN, AND OTHER GROUPS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY EXIST\nIN GUATEMALA.

MY OTHER QUESTION IS: THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY\nASKED TO PREPARE THE REINITIATION OF THE DIALOGUE.  HAS THERE BEEN ANY\nPREPARATION?  HAS THE CHURCH MADE ANY PREPARATIONS IN THIS REGARD?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WELL, [1-MINUTE BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] THAT HAS NOTHING\nTO DO WITH THAT.  AN END OF HOSTILITIES IS BASICALLY LIKE SAYING: DO\nNOT CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.\nIT IS BETTER TO DEFINE MEANINGS AND NOT TO USE TERMS THAT CREATE\nPROBLEMS OF SEMANTICS.  WHAT IS YOUR SECOND QUESTION?\n\n   [ARGUIAQ] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]\n\n   [CRISTIANI] LOGICALLY.  SOMEBODY ELSE HAS ASKED ME ALSO IF WE HAVE\nHAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE FMLN.  THIS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AT 0400.  AT\n0700 WE GOT ON A PLANE AND HERE WE ARE NOW.  WE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO\nSPEAK WITH MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR, MUCH LESS WITH THE FMLN.  BUT THIS\nINFORMATION WILL BE PASSED TO THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH\nTO BE ASKED OF THE UNITED NATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH THE\nPLEASANT SURPRISE THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN OBSERVER GROUP IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA [ONUCA] ARE ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY, TO BE INSTALLED.\n\n   MR ORTEGA, WHO HAD GONE THERE WITH THE POSITION THAT AS LONG AS THE\nRESISTANCE IS NOT DEMOBILIZED HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT ONUCA, HAD TO\nABANDON THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT WAS IRRATIONAL, AND ONUCA WILL BE\nASKED TO GO TO NICARAGUA IMMEDIATELY.\n\n   THE AGREEMENT WILL BE REPORTED TO MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  HE\nWILL ALSO RECEIVE FROM EL SALVADOR A REQUEST THAT HE WORK IN FAVOR OF\nREINITIATING THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE AGREEMENT HAS SPECIAL\nCONTENTS.  IT DOES NOT MENTION OTHER COUNTRIES BY NAME BECAUSE THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE TRIED TO PRODUCE A DOCUMENT THAT IS\nVERY RESPECTFUL OF COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE THIS AREA, BUT IT IS\nUNDENIABLE THAT THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE\nSITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE UN SECRETARY\nGENERAL, ESPECIALLY AND PERSONALLY, ARE BEING ASKED TO HELP MAKE\nSTATES THAT MEDDLE IN THE REGION SEE THAT THEY MUST HELP THE PEACE\nPROCESS PROMOTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.\n\n   OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT HAVE TO MENTION THE NAMES OF THE COUNTRIES TO\nWHICH I AM REFERRING.\n\n   IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A REAL\nSOLUTION, TO SEE THAT ALL THE FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN EXERTING\nINFLUENCE, WHETHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, WORK IN A POSITIVE WAY.

HE\n[ORTEGA] WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO\nIS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT\nHONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE\nCOMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE\nDEFENSE.\n\n   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT\nTHE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF\nTOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.\nTHIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN\nPOLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.  HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT ACCEPT THE\nREALITY.  HE COULD NO LONGER DEFEND THE POSITION THAT THE NICARAGUAN\nRESISTANCE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WAS SOMETHING ELSE AND WAS JUSTIFIABLE.  IT\nIS NOW CLEAR THAT HE HAS RUN OUT OF TRICKS AND HAS HAD TO ACCEPT WHAT\nALL THE REMAINING FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF AND\nDEFENDED AT THE COSTA RICAN SUMMIT.  NOW, IF IN THEIR STRATEGY THEY\nSOLD OUT THE FMLN, AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE, THEY WILL HAVE TO GIVE\nSOME EXPLANATIONS TO THEIR FMLN FRIENDS.  THAT IS A PROBLEM BETWEEN\nHIM AND THE FMLN.\n\n   WHAT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO US IS THAT THE FMLN'S VIOLENT AND\nTERRORIST ACTIONS ARE NO LONGER JUSTIFIED FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW.\nTHIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY AND STRONGLY EMPHASIZED IN THE COSTA RICAN\nAGREEMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, I REPEAT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS\nWILLING TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE PROCESS FROM WHICH THE FMLN\nUNILATERALLY WITHDREW.  HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE\nFMLN TO OPENLY PROMISE -- AND THIS IS STRONGLY DEMANDED BY THE CENTRAL\nAMERICAN PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT -- IT WILL\nCEASE TERRORIST ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AFFECTING CIVILIANS.\nOBVIOUSLY A TOTAL DEMOBILIZATION AND RETURN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS\n-- WITH THE GUARANTEES THAT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FMLN MEMBERS -- WILL\nBE THE RESULT OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THIS IS HOW WE UNDERSTAND AND\nVIEW THIS MATTER.  THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE\nSHALL BE THE RESULT OF A CONVINCING EFFORT BY THE NICARAGUAN\nGOVERNMENT, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES.  IN THE\nSAME DOCUMENT, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HAS UNILATERALLY VOWED TO\nENSURE THOSE GUARANTEES.\n\n   IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS\nASKED THE UNITED NATIONS TO ALSO JOIN THE CIAV [INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF\nSUPPORT AND VERIFICATION], SO THE CIAV BEGINS AND IMPLEMENTS THE PROCESS TO\nDEMOBILIZE THE FMLN. THIS IS BASICALLY THE DESIRE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS.  IF THE FMLN WANTS TO GAIN POLITICAL ADVANTAGES, IT SHOULD\nPURSUE THIS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BECAUSE IT CAN NO LONGER BE\nJUSTIFIED AND HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTIFIED.  HOWEVER, TODAY WE STRONGLY TELL THE\nFMLN THAT NO LONGER IS THERE ANY ROOM IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY IN\nEL SALVADOR, FOR VIOLENT AND TERRORIST ACTIONS.

TO\nINITIATE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, DOES THE FMLN HAVE TO DECLARE A\nCEASE-FIRE OR WOULD A PUBLIC DECLARATION BE ENOUGH?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION WE STATED ON 10 DECEMBER.  WE\nBELIEVE THAT POINT 3 OF THIS DECLARATION UPHOLDS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ALL\nALONG REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN THE SALVADORAN\nCONFLICT.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WANT THE FMLN TO PUBLICLY STATE\nTHAT THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND ALL THE VIOLENT ACTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY\nOR INDIRECTLY AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT\nENOUGH TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT.  THEY MUST KEEP THEIR WORD.  WE BELIEVE\nTHAT THERE SHOULD AT LEAST BE A 5-DAY PERIOD BETWEEN THE PUBLIC STATEMENT\nAND THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE.  WE MAINTAIN THE POSITION, THAT IS THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND MYSELF, THAT NO HOSTILE ACTIONS BY THE FMLN\nARE JUSTIFIABLE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD STOP CARRYING OUT ALL\nHOSTILE ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.  THIS INDICATES TWO THINGS WHICH MUST BE\nUNDERSTOOD.  FIRST, THE FMLN ARE THE ONLY ONES CONDUCTING HOSTILE ACTIONS.\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THAT BELONG TO IT DO NOT\nGENERATE HOSTILITIES.  THEY SIMPLY RESPOND TO THE ACTIONS OF ARMED GROUPS\nTHAT ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING TROUBLE AND OVERTHROWING A LEGITIMATE\nGOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A LEGITIMATE\nDEFENSE AND TO THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY IN FAVOR OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, AS THE CONSTITUTION STATES.  SECONDLY, THE FMLN HAS LOST\nALL MANEUVERING OPTIONS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAID IT CLEARLY\nWHEN THEY STATED THAT THE FMLN HAD NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR VIOLENT\nACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR.  THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR AN\nIMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.  THESE WERE THE SAME WORDS USED AT THE\nSUMMIT HELD IN TELA, HONDURAS.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE WILL MAINTAIN THE\nPOSITION WE HAD BEFORE, EVEN THOUGH WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS DOCUMENT.\n[CONTINUED]", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": " DEV-MUC3-0975 (SRI)", "MESSAGE:

THIS MEETING\nWAS OF URGENT NATURE TO DISCUSS ISSUES SUCH AS EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA,\nTHE CONTRAS' DEMOBILIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\n   AT THIS MEETING, WE HELD IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE\nBEING EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE\nSITUATION BEING EXPERIENCED IN NEIGHBORING EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS\nFACING AN INTERNAL CONFLICT -- MORE THAN A DECADE OF CONTINUED WAR AND\nINTERNAL CONFLICT.  EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO A VERY STRONG\nCONFRONTATION, WHICH LATELY HAS WORSENED.  AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION, THE CLERGY, NUNS, AND UNION AND LABOR LEADERS\nHAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGIC SITUATION.  AT THIS MEETING,\nNICARAGUA STATED ITS POSITION THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR MUST\nBE RESOLVED THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND NOT BY WAY OF VIOLENCE.  THIS\nPOSITION FULLY COINCIDES WITH THE POSITION THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS DEFENDED.  ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS\nTHE FMLN HAS MADE PEACE PROPOSALS AND IT HAS CALLED FOR NEGOTIATED\nSOLUTIONS TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND FOR REAL NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n   FOLLOWING A LENGTHY AND INTENSE DISCUSSION OF THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,\nWE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT, NOT ONLY WITH REGARD TO GENERAL PLEASE AND\nSTATEMENTS CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN THE NEIGHBORING CENTRAL\nAMERICAN COUNTRY, BUT ON VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT COULD LEAD TO\nSOLUTION OF THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THUS, IN POINT THREE, THE FIVE\nPRESIDENTS DECIDED TO REQUEST THAT THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL MAKE A\nVERY SPECIAL PERSONAL EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TOWARD THE\nTALKS' SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT.\n\n   NICARAGUA HAS THUS SUPPORTED THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION THE FMLN HAS\nVIGOROUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY CALLED FOR, AND WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT\nHEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ALSO CLAIMS TO AGREE.  SUCH NEGOTIATION\nWOULD LEAD TO A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT WOULD RESULTE IN SOLVING THE\nSALVADORAN CONFLICT.  LIKEWISE, WE UNDERSCORED HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA, BECAUSE THESE RIGHTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATED IN CERTAIN\nCOUNTRIES.  THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED AT INTERNATIONAL\nORGANIZATIONS.  I AM ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS\nSITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS WERE RECENTLY\nMURDERED, AND WHERE THE ARMY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF EXERTING\nINDISCRIMINATE REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE, THROUGH AERIAL AS WELL\nAS ARTILLERY AND INFANTRY ATTACKS.\n\n   THIS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IS WORRISOME TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPEOPLE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY TO NICARAGUA.  WE\nALSO REACHED AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS\nINSISTED ON THE NEED FOR RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH\nTHE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS, THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS RATIFIED\nTHEIR PLEDGES TO FULLY RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE CIVILIAN,\nPOLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THEIR\nRESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONS, AND IN SIGNED AND RATIFIED INTERNATIONAL\nAGREEMENTS.\n\n   NICARAGUA'S POSITION HAS NOT WAVERED; IT HAS MAINTAINED ITS\nPOSITIONS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES ARE WILLING TO HAVE\nRECOGNIZED INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nIN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AND HELP DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA.  THERE ARE FORCES, CENTRAL AMERICAN ARMIES ESPECIALLY, AMONG\nTHEM THE SALVADORAN ARMY -- WHICH HAS ORGANIZED DEATH SQUADS THAT\nSYSTEMATICALLY MURDER SALVADORAN PEOPLE -- WHOSE GOVERNMENTS AND\nPRESIDENTS ARE FACED WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IN OVERCOMING THE\nPROBLEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  THIS, I BELIEVE, IS WHERE THE\nGREATEST STRENGTH MUST BE EXERTED AND THE GREATEST EFFORT MADE TO\nDISBAND THE DEATH SQUADS SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE RESPECTED, A\nPEACEFUL SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND FOR ALL THE CONFLICTS IN THESE\nCOUNTRIES, AND A WORSENING OF VIOLENCE CAN BE AVOIDED, ESPECIALLY\nSINCE THIS VIOLENCE IS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE INJUSTICE THAT\nPREVAILS IN THESE COUNTRIES DUE TO A LACK OF EQUITY, FREEDOM, AND\nJUSTICE, WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

AT PRESENT, THE FMLN BELIEVES THAT DESPITE WHAT\nTHE OTHER FOUR CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SAY, IT IS CLEARER THAN\nEVER THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A FASCIST, MILITARY\nDICTATORSHIP.  THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT VIOLATES PEOPLE'S HUMAN\nRIGHTS AND THAT FACT HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVED TO THE ENTIRE\nINTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPT TO HELP THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OR ANY KIND OF SUPPORT GIVEN TO IT NOTHING BUT A\nPIECE OF PAPER THAT DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VALIDITY TO THE FMLN.\n\n   [BERNARD] IN OTHER WORDS COMRADE, THE FMLN WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME\nLEVEL OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE DICTATORSHIP?\n\n   [MONTENEGRO] I BELIEVE THE FMLN'S ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW MORE\nLEGITIMATE THAN EVER.  THE SUMMIT CONFIRMED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE\nFMLN'S STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM THAT SUMMIT IS\nNEITHER FEASIBLE NOR REAL.  THE FMLN WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS\nPOLITICAL - MILITARY OFFENSIVE.  THE FMLN WILL INCREASE ITS ACTIONS.\nTHE FMLN IS REORGANIZING [READECUAR] ITS POLITICAL - MILITARY\nAPPARATUS.  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL CLEARLY SHOW WHAT THE FMLN\nCAN DO.  THE FMLN WILL NOT SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY NOW.  THE\nFMLN HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT\nTHE SALVADORAN REALITY AT ALL.\n\n   IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CHOSE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO\nWHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS REALLY THEIR PROBLEM.\n\n   [BERNARD] TWO DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT,\nWHAT IS THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR?\n\n   [MONTENEGRO] AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION,\nTHE FIRST THING IS THAT THE FMLN DEFINATELY CHANGED THE WAR.  THIS\nMEANS THAT THE FMLN MADE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES RETREAT FROM THE\nMOUNTAINS TO THE HEART OF THE CITIES INCLUDING THE CAPITAL CITY OF SAN\nSALVADOR.\n\n   AT PRESENT, WE HAVE ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE HIGHWAYS IN\n14, I MEAN 12 SALVADORAN DEPARTMENTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ACTIONS IN\nAHUACHAPAN AND SONSONATE, TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ALMOST\nUNTOUCHED BY THE WAR.\n\n   THERE IS A STRATEGIC SIEGE IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS 65\nPERCENT OF ITS FORCES STATIONED IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE ARMY HAS\nABANDONED LARGE AREAS.\n\n   AS FOR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS, AT PRESENT THERE ARE 10 110,000-VOLT\nPRIMARY LINES THAT ARE OUT OF SERVICE.  THAT REPRESENTS A 40-PERCENT\nENERGY DEFICIT IN THE COUNTRY.  THERE HAVE BEEN LONG PERIODS OF\n100-PERCENT POWER OUTAGES IN SAN SALVADOR.  IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THAT SITUATION.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG\nTHEY WILL ENDURE IT.  BUT IN ANY CASE, A STRONG BLOW BY THE FMLN\nFORCES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN EL SALVADOR AT ANY TIME.\n[CONTINUED]", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": " DEV-MUC3-0983 (SRI)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": " 1 (OPTIONAL)", "INCIDENT: DATE": " (- 13 DEC 89) / (11 DEC 89 - 13 DEC 89)", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": " EL SALVADOR", "INCIDENT: TYPE": " ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": " ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": " -", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": " -", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": " TERRORIST ACT", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": " -", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": " \"FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\" / \"FMLN\"", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": " CLAIMED OR ADMITTED: \"FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\" / \"FMLN\"", "PHYS TGT: ID": " \"110,000-VOLT PRIMARY LINES\"", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": " ENERGY: \"110,000-VOLT PRIMARY LINES\"", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": " 10: \"110,000-VOLT PRIMARY LINES\"", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": " -", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": " DESTROYED / SOME DAMAGE: \"110,000-VOLT PRIMARY LINES\"", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": " -", "HUM TGT: NAME": " -", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": " -", "HUM TGT: TYPE": " -", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": " -", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": " -", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": " -", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": " -"}}, {"text": "   CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]\n[CONTINUED] WE COULD SAY THAT TO A GREAT EXTENT THE DECLARATION IS FULL OF\nPRETTY WORDS, SIMILAR TO THOSE CRISTIANI USES, IN THE PARTS WHERE THE\nDECLARATION CALLS ON THE FMLN TO JOIN THE ALLEGED DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND\nSAYS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS LEGITIMATE.  HOWEVER, IF WE LOOK\nCAREFULLY, WE CAN SEE WHAT IS BEHIND THE WORDS AND THAT IN ADDITION TO\nDECLARING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DO THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY A FAVOR.  THIS IS DONE BY ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP ALL\nVIOLENT ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.\n\n   WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT REFERS TO SIEGES ON CITIES,\nTO TRANSPORTATION STRIKES, AND TO SABOTAGE, THE ARMY'S MOST SERIOUS\nSOURCES OF CONCERN.

ALL CHILEANS SHOULD BE PROUD FOR ONCE AGAIN PARTICIPATING IN AN\nEXEMPLARY ELECTION.\n\n   2.

THEY ENABLED THIS\nELECTION TO BE HELD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE, AND THEREBY ALLOWED\nTHE FREE EXPRESSION OF CIVIC WILL.

IT WAS NOT JUST A TASK OF SIMPLE RESTORATION, BUT\nPRIMARILY A CREATIVE TASK WHICH, IN ORDER TO SUCCEED, HAD TO BE\nCARRIED OUT IN THE DEEP ROOTS OF NATIONAL TRADITION.\n\n   6. THE ARMED FORCES AND CARABINEROS FULFILLED THE COMMITMENT MADE\nIN SEPTEMBER L973.  THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED.  AUTHENTIC\nDEMOCRACY AS A WAY OF LIFE AND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CREATED,\nAND THE TRANSITION PROCESS ENDS ON 11 MARCH L990.
