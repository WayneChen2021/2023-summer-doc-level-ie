[{"text": "   LIMA, 8 MAY 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] SENATOR LUIS\nALBERTO SANCHEZ HAS BEEN DESIGNATED NEW PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF\nMINISTERS.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ON ARRIVING AT\nGOVERNMENT PALACE AFTER PAYING HOMAGE IN CONGRESS TO LATE [APRA\nAMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALAN GARCIA] I THINK IT IS A BARBAROUS CRIME WHICH WE\nMUST REPUDIATE AND AGAINST WHICH WE MUST ALL FIGHT.\n\n   WE NEED TO PUT ALL POLICE FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  WE\nCAN NO LONGER SCATTER OUR EFFORTS AND KEEP SOME SECTORS IDLE.  I HAVE SEEN\nPOLICE AGENTS WORKING AS DRIVERS, SOME OF THEM PLAYING THE ROLE OF GREAT\nPERSONALITIES, OF CHIEFS. I HAVE SEEN MANY POLICEMEN DOING ADMINISTRATIVE\nWORK.  WE ARE PAYING THOSE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TRAINED THEM TO FIGHT AGAINST\nOUR MAIN ENEMY, WHICH IS TERRORISM.\n\n   I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, AND\nWITH HIM ALL MEMBERS OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET, HAVE PRESENTED THEIR\nRESIGNATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA FEELS THAT A POLITICAL\nRENEWAL IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC SECTORS TO\nPARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION.  THE MURDER OF\nANOTHER CONGRESSMAN HAS LED THE MINISTERS TO PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS.\n\n   THIS POLITICAL RENEWAL MUST LEAD ALL PERUVIANS TO JOIN EFFORTS.  WE MUST\nFORGET OUR ELECTORAL CONFRONTATIONS AND ADVERSITIES FOR A WHILE AND\nUNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE\nELECTIONS.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, THAT WE\nARE AT WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS WAR REPRESENTS A COST OF\nTHOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF INTIS, DOZENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE MUST MAKE\nTHIS TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO END SUBVERSION ONCE AND FOR ALL.

WE CONTACTED HIM BY TELEPHONE, AS FOLLOWS:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SORTO] COLONEL, IS IT TRUE THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL\nOR NATIONAL OPERATION TO ATTACK THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE?\n\n   [VARGAS] I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF A REGIONAL OR NATIONAL\nOPERATION.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT THESE ARE TREACHEROUS, COWARDLY ACTIONS,\nBECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF CONFRONTING THE SOLDIERS, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE\nMILITARY UNITS.  IN SAN MIGUEL, THERE WERE FIVE EXPLOSIONS IN OPEN AREAS\nABOUT 2 TO 3 KM APART.  THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE\nINFLICTED ON THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE OR ITS INSTALLATIONS.  THEY HIT SOME\nFUEL TANKS FILLED WITH ABOUT 3,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE, WHICH STARTED A\nFIRE.  HOWEVER, THE FIRES WERE IN OPEN AREAS, SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO\nCASUALTIES OR MATERIAL DAMAGE TO THE INSTALLATIONS.\n\n   [SORTO] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] CLAIMS IT\nSEIZED EL SALITRE ESTATE AND, FROM THERE, ATTACKED THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE.\n\n   [VARGAS] EL SALITRE ESTATE WAS NOT OCCUPIED.  AN OLD SHACK ON THE ESTATE\nWAS SET ABLAZE, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTROLLED THE FIRE.  I THINK THESE\nARE THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY VICTORIES THE FMLN TALKS ABOUT: ATTACKS AGAINST\nFIXED INSTALLATIONS THAT CONTAIN NO MILITARY UNITS, WHERE NOT EVEN PEASANTS\nARE SLEEPING AT THE TIME.  I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE FMLN SAYS IT FIGHTS\nHEROICALLY FOR 4 HOURS TO BURN SEVEN PATCHES OF CROPS AND HOW IT CLAIMS IT\nHEROICALLY FIGHTS TO DOWN POWER TOWERS, WHICH ARE UNMOVING OBJECTS.  THESE\nARE THE ONLY GREAT ACTIONS IT CARRIES OUT, BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE AGAINST\nFIXED TARGETS THAT CANNOT MOVE.  I REPEAT, THESE ARE COWARDLY ACTIONS THAT\nDO NOT CONFRONT THE SOLDIERS WHO REPRESENT THE MILITARY ABILITIES OF THE\nGOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY.\n\n   [SORTO] DO YOU HAVE ANY UNITS COMBING THE AREA?  \n\n   [VARGAS] YES, DEFINITELY, WE HAVE MEN IN THE AREA.  THE TRUTH IS THAT\nAT 0200 TODAY, UNITS WERE BEING MOBILIZED.  AS I SAID, THESE ARE COWARDLY\nACTIONS, CARRIED OUT IN THE DARK, AND THE FMLN FLEES WHEN IT SEES OUR\nWELL-TRAINED MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORM.  THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.\n\n   [SORTO] YOU HAVE PERMANENT GUARDS FOR SAN MIGUEL.  SOME OF THE MARKET\nVENDORS TOLD US FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT A SINGLE SHOT WAS HEARD.\n\n   [VARGAS] YES, THAT IS RIGHT.  AS I SAID, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ATTACKS\nOR HARASSMENT, JUST FIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY\nCHANGES IN THE CORRELATION OF MILITARY FORCES.  THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL\nSHOULD BE CALM; WE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SECURITY.  THE PEOPLE OF THE\nEASTERN AREA OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CALM, BECAUSE WE WILL INCREASE OUR\nABILITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE SECURITY POSSIBLE.  THE\nFMLN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR BEING SO AUDACIOUS.\n\n   [SORTO] THE FMLN SAID IT WAS FIGHTING IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.  \n\n   [VARGAS] WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ACTION IN BERLIN AND ALEGRIA.

IT SHOWS THE\nCHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT'S PRECARIOUSNESS.  UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD\nITS LUKEWARM ELECTION PROMISES, THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A COMPLETELY\nDEFENSIVE POLICY.  HARASSED BY ATTEMPTED COUPS, GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION,\nADMINISTRATIVE INEPTNESS, AND INSURGENT ACTIVITIES, CEREZO'S\nADMINISTRATION IS PLAGUED BY EVIDENT INSTABILITY.  HIS GOVERNMENT IS\nSTILL HOSTAGE TO THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH TEMPORARILY\nSURRENDERED POWER AFTER MANY YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, CEREZO IS THE VICTIM OF MILITARY MEN WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT\nAWAY FROM POSITIONS OF GREATER POWER BY THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS.  THIS SEEMS\nTO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE MOST RECENT PLOT AGAINST THE CIVILIAN\nGOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT, MASTERMINDED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS, WAS CRUSHED BY\nOFFICERS WHO DECIDED TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT FOR THE TIME BEING.\n\n   GUATEMALA, 85 PERCENT OF WHOSE POPULATION LIVES IN POVERTY, IS PLAGUED BY\nPARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT SPREAD PANIC, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE PEASANT AND\nINDIAN POPULATION, IN COLLUSION WITH THE POWERFUL AND WELL-ARMED ARMY.\nANOTHER SIGN OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INCREASING WEAKNESS IS THAT IMPORTANT\nDECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, WHICH DOMINATES KEY\nECONOMIC SECTORS.\n\n   CEREZO'S POWER WAS THREATENED A FEW DAYS AGO BY THE DISCLOSURE THAT\nGUATEMALAN FORCES FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN STAGING JOINT COUNTERINSURGENCY\nOPERATIONS WITH U.S. SOLDIERS.  THIS PARTICIPATION CASTS DOUBTS ON CEREZO'S\nALLEGED ACTIVE NEUTRALITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TURNS GUATEMALA INTO JUST\nANOTHER SPRINGBOARD FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. FORCES AS PART OF THE\nSO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY WAR.  ACCORDING TO THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL\nREVOLUTIONARY UNITY, WAR EXERCISES ARE STAGED IN GUATEMALA WITH TROOPS FROM\nTHE U.S. BASES IN THE PANAMA CANAL AREA.  ON 31 JANUARY, A U.S. PILOT FLYING\nA U.S. PLANE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO LAND AT THE GUATEMALA CITY AIR\nFORCE BASE.  THE REBELS ASSERTED THE PLANE WAS HIT BY ANTIAIRCRAFT FIRE.  IN\nADDITION, U.S. TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN GUATEMALA'S CHIMALTENANGO DEPARTMENT\nIN NOVEMBER 1988.\n\n   SHORTLY AFTER THE MURDER OF 22 PEASANTS LAST FEBRUARY, THE GUERRILLAS\nNOTICED FLIGHTS NEAR THE SCENE OF THE MASSACRE BY U.S.  AIR FORCE CHINOOK\nHELICOPTERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS OR IN MISSIONS\nTO SUPPORT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY.  \n\n   THE MOST RECENT COUP ATTEMPT IN GUATEMALA AND THE DISCOVERY OF AN\nINCREASING PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN THAT COUNTRY HAS PLACED CEREZO'S\nGOVERNMENT IN A SERIOUS, DIFFICULT POSITION.

THE PRESENCE HERE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE\nGROUP OF 8, WITH JUST ONE EXCEPTION, WAS AGREED DURING A PREVIOUS\nCONVERSATION IN WHICH WE DECIDED THAT PARAGUAY MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE\nTHAT IT DESERVES FOLLOWING THE RECENT ELECTIONS THAT REFLECTED THE WILL OF\nTHE PEOPLE.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT, THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRATIC\nINSTITUTIONS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN?  \n\n   [LARCO COX] IT MEANS THAT THE PARAGUAYAN OPPOSITION WAS ABLE TO PERFORM\nITS SUPERVISORY ROLE WITHOUT OBSTACLES, AND THAT THE PROCESS WAS OBSERVED\nBY INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS, WHO MADE USE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO\nGUARANTEE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS.\n\n   [REPORTER] YOUR REMARKS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT THE\nPERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS FIGHTING A GUERRILLA FORCE THAT JEOPARDIZES THE\nDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.\n\n   [LARCO COX] RIGHT.  IN PERU WE ARE FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  IT IS A\nWELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE WORLD IS RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS\nOF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED DURING AN ANTISUBVERSIVE ACTION.  YET THERE IS\nLITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO DEFEND DEMOCRACY,\nWITHIN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST DEFEND ITSELF.  IN THIS CONTEXT THE\nSUBJECT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT WELL DEFINED.\n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU MEAN THAT A MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS AT TIMES MORE\nEFFECTIVE?\n\n   [LARCO COX] NO.  IT IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE FOR REPRESSION, BUT I MADE IT\nCLEAR THAT SUBVERSION IN A DEMOCRACY IS UNJUSTIFIED AND THAT DEMOCRATIC\nGOVERNMENTS DO NOT PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  IF THERE ARE ANY HUMAN\nRIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN A DEMOCRACY, THEY STEM FROM EXCESSES BY THE REPRESSIVE\nFORCES.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN THESE TYPES OF REPRESSION?\n\n   [LARCO COX] IT IS SIMPLE.  IN A DICTATORSHIP, REPRESSION IS WIDESPREAD\nAND ALMOST ALWAYS ARBITRARY, AND THERE IS NO ONE TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\n   [REPORTER] IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ALAN GACIA HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT THERE\nIS A LIMIT TO WHAT A CHARISMATIC LEADER CAN DO.  IN FACT, HE IS YOUNG,\nHANDSOME, AND HE IS A GOOD SPEAKER.  HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE\nPROBLEMS.  WHAT DOES PERU NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE MUCH DESIRED\nSTABILIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS?\n\n   [LARCO COX] PERU NEEDS ECONOMIC STABILITY, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT\nEXPERIENCE AND WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO DISTRIBUTE WEALTH.  THE\nDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WAS DONE DURING THE FIRST 2 AND 1/2 YEARS.  THE\nNEGATIVE SIDE OF THIS IS THAT DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION WAS OVERSTIMULATED.\nEVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM CONTRADICTORY, OUR PRODUCTIVE APPARATUS NEEDED\nMORE IMPORTED MATERIALS IN ORDER TO INCREASE LOCAL PRODUCTION.  THIS LED\nTO A DANGEROUS DECREASE IN OUR RESERVES.  SIMULTANEOUSNLY, THE BANK\nNATIONALIZATION LAW WAS SET IN MOTION.  THIS PROVIDED THE PERFECT\nFRAMEWORK FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM.  THERE WAS ALSO THE EARLY\nSTART TO THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND FINALLY THE RADICAL OPPOSITION BY THE\nBUSINESS SECTOR OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GROWTH IN THE CRIME RATE AND THE COSTLY\nPROCESS OF FIGHTING THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IN\nURBAN TERRORIST ACTIONS.  THIS COULD EASILY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT\nPERUVIAN DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PROSPECTS, RIGHT?\n\n   [LARCO COX] QUITO TO THE CONTRARY.  DEMOCRACY WILL BE PRESERVED EVEN IF\nTHE NORMAL HANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION BECOMES THE ONLY\nOBJECTIVE OF THE RECENTLY INSTALLED CABINET.  THIS, HOWEVER, WILL BECOME\nTHE SOLE OBJECTIVE ONLY IN AN ESTREME SITUATION.  THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY OTHER\nOBJECTIVES, BUT I WANT TO STRESS THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT WE ATTACH TO THE\nHANDING OVER OF POWER TO THE WINNER OF CLEAN ELECTIONS, WITH GUARANTEES FOR\nALL OPPOSITION PARTIES.

IT WAS NECESSARY FOR\nTHE SANTA LUCIA MAYOR TO INTERVENE BEFORE THEY COULD TELL NEWSMEN WHAT HAD\nHAPPENED.  A REPORTER FOR LA PRENSA WAS SIDETRACKED BY A COMMANDER, NO DOUBT\nTO KEEP HIM FROM DOING HIS JOB AS A JOURNALIST.\n\n   THE HONDURAN ARMY'S WEAPONS SERVED TO KEEP THE AGGRESSION QUIET INSTEAD\nOF REPELLING IT, TO THREATEN HONDURAN BORDER VILLAGERS INSTEAD OF\nPROTECTING THEM, WHILE THE ARMY TURNED ITS BACK ON THE ENEMY ARMED FORCES\n-- WHICH HAVE TRAMPLED ON OUR TERRITORY AND HUMILIATED US -- INSTEAD OF\nFIGHTING THEM.  IN SHORT, THE WEAPONS THAT WE HONDURANS AND THE ARMED\nFORCES HAVE OBTAINED WITH SO MUCH SACRIFICE, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GOING\nWITHOUT FOOD AND MEDICINE, ARE USED AGAINST HONDURAS AND ITS PEOPLE.  \n\n   THIS SITUATION SHOULD CAUSE US TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE EXISTENCE OF\nTHE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES.

FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR\nECONOMIC -- THOUGH IDEOLOGICALLY DISGUISED -- BENEFITS.\n\n   NO NATIONAL MILITARY FORCE CAN FUNCTION LIKE THIS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.\nIN ANY EVENT, THE IDEOLOGY OF ANY ARMY SHOULD BE NATIONALISTIC, EVEN IN THE\nCASE OF POWERS AND SUPERPOWERS THAT INVENT AND USE INTERNATIONALIST\nIDEOLOGIES FOR THEIR HEGEMONIC STRUGGLES.\n\n   HERE IN HONDURAS THE CASE OF THE ARMED FORCES IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.  TO\nTHE MILITARY INSTITUTE'S WAY OF THINKING, THOSE WHO ARE DEMANDING THE\nDEFENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY ARE SUBVERSIVES WHO ARE\nALLIED WITH SUBVERSIVES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  AN AGGRESSION AGAINST\nHONDURAS BY A FOREIGN ARMY IS LEGITIMIZED BY THE PEOPLE ATTACKED AND THOSE\nWHO INFORM AND PROTEST ARE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND.\n\n   THIS WAS STATED IN AN EDITORIAL OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' \"MILITARY\nPROJECTIONS\" PROGRAM.  THE EDITORIAL SAID THAT THE REPORT WAS ISSUED\n\"WITHOUT PRIOR INVESTIGATION\" AND WAS BASED SOLELY \"ON INFORMATION PROVIDED\nBY THESE GROUPS TO CONFUSE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION.\"\n\n   \"THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF SOME PRINT AND BROADCAST MEDIA DIRECTORS HAS\nREACHED THE POINT THAT THEY ARE PROMOTING THESE CLEARLY MARXIST - LENINIST\nSUBVERSIVES, FINANCED BY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, AND THOSE WHO DO NOT HIDE THEIR\nOPEN SYMPATHY WITH PSEUDO-PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS.

HAS SUPPORTED -- AGAINST THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS\nOF THE HONDURAN PEOPLE -- THE OPTION SET FORTH BY A U.S. BIPARTISAN\nAGREEMENT AIMED AT MAINTAINING THE CONTRAS IN HONDURAN TERRITORY.  \n\n   INTERVIEWS WITH HONDURAN POLITICAL LEADERS, SUCH AS THE ONE PUBLISHED IN\nTHE DAILY LA TRIBUNA IN ITS 13 JUNE EDITION, CLEARLY STATE THAT THE U.S.\nVICE PRESIDENT DID NOT GO TO HONDURAS TO SOLVE ITS

CONTINUING THE HEAVY BURDEN ON THE\nHONDURAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST\nACTIONS.  \n\n   WITH THIS BEHAVIOR, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN EVINCES ITS TOTAL\n NONCOMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN\nTHE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS, TO NOT PERMIT THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO ATTACK\nOTHER STATES AND TO DISCONTINUE ITS SUPPORT FOR IRREGULAR FORCES.\n\n   THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT STRONGLY PROTESTS THE FACT THAT YOUR COUNTRY\nCONTINUES TO ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY TO CONDUCT ILLEGAL POLICIES THAT\nGO AGAINST THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS AND THE PEACE EFFORTS AND THAT VIOLATE\nTHE PRINCIPLES AND NORMS ESTABLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO GUARANTEE THE\nPEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF STATES.\n\n   YOUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFLECT ON THIS AND HEED THE CALLS MADE BY THE\nHONDURAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES, WHO DEMAND AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S INVOLVEMENT\nIN AN ILLEGAL AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY AND THAT THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA\nDEL SOL CALLING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A JOINT PLAN FOR THE\nDEMOBILIZATION, REPATRIATION, AND RELOCATION OF THE IRREGULAR FORCES BASED\nIN YOUR COUNTRY BE HONORED.\n\n   I TAKE THIS

A VEHICLE FILLED WITH 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS USED TO TRY TO\nASSASSINATE THE HEAD OF STATE SECURITY.  THE GENERAL ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY\nBUT DURING THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 7 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MORE THAN 50\nWERE WOUNDED.  BECAUSE OF THIS ACT DIFFERENCES IN THE ARMED FORCES AND IN\nTHE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER INTENSIFIED.\n\n   MAZA MARQUEZ HAS BEEN THE SWORN ENEMY OF THE MAFIA AND THE OBJECT OF\nTHEIR THREATS SINCE HE REVEALED THAT THE GANGS WHICH CARRY OUT ASSASSINATION\nATTEMPTS AGAINST THE CCP AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION ARE TRAINED MERCENARIES\nFROM THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE FRG, AND GREAT BRITAIN.  AFTER ESCAPING\nFROM AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON 3 MAY, GENERAL MAZA MARQUEZ SENT A LETTER\nTO THE STATE PROSECUTOR.  IN IT HE SAID THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY KNEW\nABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED AGAINST HIM.  \n\n   DURING THE SAME PERIOD CAPTAIN WANUMEN [NAME AS PUBLISHED] WAS\nIMPRISONED; HE HAD SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, THE\nNATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA, THE DAS, AND THE\nAMERICAN CIA WHICH LIST HIGHLY PLACED INDIVIDUALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO WORK\nAS \"SPIES\" FOR THE BENEFIT OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM THE MEDELLIN AND CALI\nCARTELS.  ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO VARGAS DENIED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE\nDOCUMENTS, REPORTS ARE GENERALLY DISSEMINATED THAT THE RULING ELITE HAS BEEN\nINFILTRATED WITH MAFIA AGENTS.\n\n   IN THIS SITUATION SPACE OPENS UP FOR THE CCP'S PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE\nPEACE TO THE COUNTRY BY WAY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL\nPARTISAN GROUPS, NOT JUST WITH THE M-19 MOVEMENT, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS\nPRACTICED TO DATE.

HONDURAS, HOWEVER, HAS ALSO BEEN\nAFFECTED BY THESE ACTIONS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS.\n\n   WE RECALL THE DEPLORABLE KIDNAPPING OF 100 PERSONS AT THE CHAMBER OF\nCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES IN CORTES IN 1982; THE ILLEGAL HIJACKING OF\nTAN-SAHSA AIRCRAFT BY TERRORIST COMMANDOS WHO ALWAYS ENDED UP SEEKING REFUGE\nIN MANAGUA OR HAVANA; THE PLANTING OF TWO BOMBS THAT DESTROYED POWER PLANTS\nIN TEGUCIGALPA, AS WELL AS OTHER TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST HONDURAS BOTH INSIDE\nAND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY; CLANDESTINE ARMS TRAFFICKING, ETC.\n\n   ON 27-28 JUNE, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED BY A\nSTATEMENT MADE IN SAN PEDRO SULA BY A NICARAGUAN CITIZEN WHO, ACCORDING TO\nHIS STATEMENTS, IS AN ARMY CAPTAIN AND INTELLIGENCE AGENT FOR THE SANDINIST\nREGIME.  HE DISCLOSED THAT, IN AUGUST 1988, HE WAS ASSIGNED THE MISSIONS OF\nPLANNING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE\nBEHEADING OF THE HONDURAN SPIRITUAL AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE\nPHYSICAL ELIMINATION OF HONDURAN ARCHBISHOP MSGR HECTOR ENRIQUE SANTOS AND\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CARLOS ROBERTO FLORES AND RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS\nROMERO, OF THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES RESPECTIVELY.\n\n   THE SANDINIST FOREIGN MINISTRY RESPONDED TO THESE REPORTS BY ISSUING A 29\nJULY 1989 COMMUNIQUE, IN WHICH IT OPENLY ADMITTED THAT NICARAGUAN CITIZEN\nORLANDO ADAN SOLORZANO MARTINEZ WAS AN ARMY LIEUTENANT -- NOT A CAPTAIN --\nAND THAT HE HAD WORKED FOR THE NICARAGUAN INTERIOR MINISTRY FOR 7 AND 1/2\nYEARS, FROM 20 AUGUST 1979 TO 28 JANUARY 1987.\n\n   THE COMMUNIQUE ADDED THAT ON 28 JANUARY 1987, SOLORZANO HAD BEEN FIRED\nAND THAT HIS RECORD SHOWED A LONG LIST OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THIS\nEXPLANATION VERY CONVENIENTLY ALLOWS NICARAGUA TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM\nTHE ESPIONAGE AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENT IN THE\nEVENT HE WAS CAUGHT OR DESERTED.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT,\nBECAUSE OF ITS IDEOLOGY AND BECAUSE IT HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE FINANCING AND\nTRAINING -- BOTH POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY -- OF CENTRAL AMERICAN\nTERRRORIST GROUPS, HAS BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED AT VARIOUS LEVELS IN THESE\nGROUPS' CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL NORMS ON PEACEFUL\nCOEXISTENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

ON THE MORNING OF 5 JULY A GROUP OF 52 PEOPLE\nIN TWO BUSES VISITED THE \"ALBATROS\" STORE, AS IS THE CUSTOM AMONG OFF-DUTY\nCREWS FROM SOVIET FISHING VESSELS WORKING IN PERUVIAN COASTAL WATERS.  THE\nEXPLOSION OCCURRED ON ONE OF THE BUSES AS IT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE.\n\n   FORTUNATELY, THE BOMB WAS HOMEMADE AND NOT THAT POWERFUL.  AND IT HAD\nOBVIOUSLY BEEN HASTILY PLANTED (ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, FOUR SUSPICIOUS\nCHARACTERS HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE BUS).  THE PASSENGERS WERE INJURED\nMAINLY BY PIECES OF BROKEN GLASS.\n\n   THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE ON THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY.  NEARLY\nALL THE CASUALTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY HOSPITALIZED.  IT IS TRUE THAT AT FIRST\nTHERE WAS A MIXUP IN THE HOSPITAL OVER RUSSIAN NAMES -- IT TOOK THE DOCTORS\nA WHILE TO WORK OUT WHICH PHOTOGRAPH BELONGED TO WHOM.  REPRESENTATIVES OF\nTHE SOVIET EMBASSY AND CONSULATE CAME TO THEIR AID.  ON THE SAME DAY SKILLED\nOPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT ON ALL THOSE WHO REQUIRED THEM.  THE IZVESTIYA\nCORRESPONDENT WAS OFFICIALLY INFORMED THAT THE SERIOUSLY INJURED SOVIET\nSEAMEN WERE OUT OF DANGER.  THEIR FAMILIES HAD BEEN INFORMED.\n\n   THE PERUVIAN PRESS BELIEVES THAT THE TERRORIST ACT CARRIED OUT AGAINST\nSOVIET CITIZENS WAS THE WORK OF THE MAOIST-INCLINED LEFTIST ARMED GROUPING\n\"SENDERO LUMINOSO.\"  BUT THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION:  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nCARRIED OUT BY ULTRARIGHTISTS OPPOSING THE FISHING AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN\nPERU AND THE USSR.

I AM A BIT CONCERNED OVER WHAT I HAVE HEARD ON\nTHIS RADIO STATION.  THE TRUTH IS THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0030 TODAY,\nTHERE WAS AN ATTACK WITH A HOMEMADE BOMB IN LA CEIBA, AND, AS A\nRESULT, SEVEN U.S.  SOLDIERS -- NOT SIX -- WERE WOUNDED.  FOUR\nSUSTAINED VERY MINOR INJURIES, WHILE THREE WERE SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY\nWOUNDED, BUT THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER OF DYING.  NINE SOLDIERS WERE IN\nTHAT GROUP.  THEY WERE NOT ON LEAVE; THEY WERE ON A MISSION FROM THE\nENRIQUE SOTO CANO HONDURAN AIR BASE AT PALMEROLA.\n\n   THEY PROVOKED...  [CHANGES THOUGHT].  INSTEAD, I SHOULD SAY THAT\nTHEY WENT TO HAVE SOME FUN AT THE DILIDO DISCOTEQUE. OUR MILITARY POLICE\nPATROLS WERE IN THE AREA AND SAW THE ATTACK.  WE CAPTURED TWO SUSPECTS.  OUR\nMEN WERE ABOUT 100 METERS AWAY WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED, AND, UNFORTUNATELY,\nTHE TWO SUSPECTS ARE U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WERE IN THE\nAREA AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.  THIS IS AN OFFICIAL REPORT; THIS\nIS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN LA CEIBA.  THE TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED, AND THEY\nMUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEVEN WHO WERE WOUNDED, WHO ARE AT THE [WORD\nINDISTINCT] HOSPITAL.  WHAT YOU REPORTED OVER THE RADIO IS CORRECT.  THERE\nIS NO NEED TO BE ALARMED.  IT WAS A HOMEMADE BOMB, AND THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED\nBY THE SHRAPNEL, CEMENT, AND STONES THAT WERE THROWN INTO THE AIR BY THE\nEXPLOSION.  \n\n   HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO DENY A REPORT BY THE MILKMAN FROM [WORD\nINDISTINCT], WHO SAID THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AND IS BEING HELD\nHOSTAGE.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nTHE PATROLS WERE ALREADY ON THE STREETS AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT.  FUSEP\n[THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCE] WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS, AND\nTHEREFORE VEHICLES ENTERING OR LEAVING LA CEIBA WERE STOPPED AND SEARCHED.\nTHAT IS ALL; STANDSTILL MERELY BECAUSE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nWOUNDED, OR BECAUSE TWO OR THREE ARE CRITICALLY WOUNDED.\n\n   THE CITY MUST FUNCTION NORMALLY.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE INTERESTED IN THE\nCONTINUATION OF PRODUCTION.  SO THE MAN FROM [WORD INDISTINCT] WHO CALLED\nAND SAID THAT HE WAS LOSING 100,000 LEMPIRAS [AS A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE\nSEARCHES] THIS MORNING WAS TELLING A LIE.  WE GAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS\nTHAT THE INSPECTION OF VEHICLES SHOULD BE CARRIED UNTIL 0500, AND THAT THE\nVEHICLES SHOULD NOT BE DETAINED.\n\n   [REPORTER] COLONEL, IT WAS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDED\nTHE REPORT AND SAID THAT THE DELIVERY OF MILK HAD BEEN STOPPED.\n\n   [SANCHEZ] WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR HIM -- WHOM I DO NOT KNOW PERSONALLY\n-- I MUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE ARE STOPPING VEHICLES [AS HEARD].\nWE STOPPED A VERY SMALL WHITE VAN WITH SOME LABORERS IN IT TO SEARCH THE\nVAN.  I WAS THERE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THERE WAS NO MILK ON THAT BUS; THERE\nWERE PEOPLE ON THAT BUS, AND I MYSELF ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE.  I AM\nSORRY THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN MISINFORMED.  WE ARE NOT\nPARALYZING ACTIVITIES, NOR ARE WE HOLDING THE CITY HOSTAGE.  AS I SAID, WE\nARE TRYING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.\nWE ARE NOT SURE IF THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PERPETRATED THE ATTACK; WE ARE\nNOT SURE OF ANYTHING.  WE ARE MERELY CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND TAKING\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES.\n\n   [REPORTER] COLONEL, ARE THE TWO MEN YOU HAVE IN CUSTODY THE SAME U.S.\nCITIZENS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT?\n\n   [SANCHEZ] YES.  THE LIEUTENANT IN CHARGE OF THE PATROL [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nTHE PANTS, CLOTHES, AND THE COLOR OF WHAT THEY WERE WEARING INDICATED THAT\nTHEY WERE CIVILIANS.  LIEUTENANT SALGADO OF THE 4TH BATTALION WAS 50 METERS\nAWAY WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  TWO PERSONS WERE CAPTURED.  HOWEVER, THEY\nHAVE DENIED THAT EITHER OF THEM WAS INVOLVED.  THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  WE\nHAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES FOR THE ARMED FORCES INVESTIGATIVE\nPERSONNEL TO ARRIVE TO LEARN THE IDENTITIES OF THE TWO MEN WHO ARE BEING\nHELD.  THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL.  WE [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] TWO OR THREE PERSONS WERE INJURED.  WE ARE NOT PARALYZING\nPRODUCTION; I WANT TO MADE THIS CLEAR.\n\n   [REPORTER] YES, OF COURSE.  COLONEL, GIVEN THE SITUATION, DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHAT THE SITUATION IN THE ARMED FORCES IS COMPLETELY NORMAL?\n\n   [SANCHEZ] OF COURSE IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.  WE ARE NOT RESTRICTING\nANYONE'S FREEDOM.  WHEN IT GETS DARK, WE WILL PROCEED TO ASK FOR\nIDENTIFICATION PAPERS; WE WILL STOP AND CHECK VEHICLES, WHICH IS NORMAL IN\nTHIS TYPE OF SITUATION.  HOWEVER, AT NO TIME WILL WE PARALYZE PRODUCTION OR\nNORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES.  WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHIS ATTACK.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST U.S.  CITIZENS,\nIT WAS CERTAINLY AN ATTACK AGAINST PEACE AND ORDER.  WE THEREFORE HAVE TO\nINVESTIGATE IT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT INVOLVED U.S.  CITIZENS.  IN\nTHIS CASE, AND IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, I PERSONALLY ISSUED ORDERS AND\nFOLLOWED THE INVESTIGATION UNTIL 0500, WHEN I SUSPENDED ALL OPERATIONS.  I\nPERSONALLY ORDERED THESE MEASURES.  I AM AMAZED THAT THE CATTLEMEN DO NOT\nTRANSPORT MILK BEFORE 0500.\n\n   [REPORTER] ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS MATTER:  IS THE SITUATION IN LA\nCEIBA RELATED TO THE LATEST VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN SAN PEDRO SULA?\n\n   [SANCHEZ] I BELIEVE SO.  A SERIES OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS HAS BEEN LAUNCHED\nAGAINST SOCIAL PEACE IN HONDURAS.  THIS STATION'S LISTENERS AND LISTENERS OF\nALL OTHER HONDURAN RADIO STATIONS KNOW THE HIGH - CALIBER OF THE ARMED\nFORCES PERSONNEL, BEGINNING WITH THE TOP COMMANDERS AND CONTINUING WITH\nOFFICERS DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.  WE ARE SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL ISSES AND\nARE NOT MOTIVATED BY VESTED INTERESTS OF ANY KIND.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE\nACTS OF BLOODSHED, WHICH ARE [WORDS INDISTINCT], ARE PART OF A SERIES OF\nFULLY PLANNED, COLDLY CALULATED ACTIONS.\n\n   I DO NOT WANT TO SOUND LIKE A COMIC STRIP CHARACTER, BUT I BELIEVE THAT\nTHESE ACTIONS ARE CONNECTED AND OVERLAP.  I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].  WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED WHITE HANDS\nAND BLACK HANDS [DEATH SQUADS], WHICH CONCERN US VERY MUCH.  WE ARE\nTALKING ABOUT HONDURANS KILLING HONDURANS.  \n\n   [REPORTER] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO THIS STATION.  WE\nWILL BE CONTACTING YOU DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS HOMEMADE BOMB ATTACK IN LA CEIBA.\n\n   [SANCHEZ] WE ARE COMPLETELY AT YOUR SERVICE.  WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOU\nINFORMATION AS IT COMES IN.  WE ARE A COMPLETELY OPEN, NOT CLOSED,\nORGANIZATION.  WE WILL GIVE YOU TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL INFORMATION FOR THE\nBENEFIT OF ALL HONDURANS.  \n\n   [REPORTER] THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING, COLONEL.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0290 (ITP, NYU)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   BOGOTA, 13 JUL 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] TEN\nPEOPLE WERE KILLED IN COLOMBIA DURING A THWARTED ATTACK AGAINST\nPATIOTIC UNION COUNCILMAN GONZALO ALVAREZ HENAO IN MEDELLIN.
