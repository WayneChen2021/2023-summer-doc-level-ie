THE FOREIGN OFFICE STRESSED THE DECISION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT\nON BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS, WHERE 1,000 BRITONS WERE\nKILLED AND WOUNDED DURING THE WAR.\n\n   BRITAIN HAS AGREED TO LIFT THE 150-MILE MILITARY PROTECTION ZONE\nAROUND THE FALKLANDS FROM MARCH 31.  AT THE SAME TIME NEW MUTUALLY\nAGREED SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL COME INTO FORCE.  THESE WILL INVOLVE\n25 DAYS ADVANCE NOTIFICATION BY EACH SIDE OF MILITARY MANOEUVRES IN\nCERTAIN AREAS.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN AGREED THERE SHOULD BE 48-HOURS\nNOTICE FOR NAVAL SHIPS WHICH WANT TO APPROACH CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN\n50 NAUTICAL MILES AND 70 NAUTICAL MILES FOR AIRCRAFT.\n\n   FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL COME INTO FORCE AS SOON AS THE\nPROTECTING POWERS FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED.  BRITAIN'S\nINTERESTS IN ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY SWITZERLAND SINCE\n1982.  ARGENTINA'S INTERESTS IN LONDON HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED BY BRAZIL\nFROM THE SAME PERIOD.\n\n   TALKS ON FISHERIES AROUND THE FALKLANDS WILL CONTINUE.  A WORKING\nGROUP ON SOUTH ATLANTIC AFFAIRS IS TO BE SET UP.  ITS FIRST MEETING\nWILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AN ARGENTINE VISIT TO WAR\nCEMETERIES IN THE FALKLANDS WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO AHEAD.  THIS WILL BE\nWORKED OUT THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS.\n\n   BOTH SIDES HAVE ALSO AGREED THAT VISAS REQUIREMENTS WILL BE\nABOLISHED.  BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA HAVE ALSO AGREED TO COOPERATE ON\nDRUGS AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n   THE BRITISH DELEGATION TO THE TALKS WAS LED BY SIR CRISPIN TICKELL,\nAMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ARGENTINE DELEGATION BY SENOR\nGARCIA DEL SOLAR, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM.\n\n   THE AGREEMENT IS THE OUTCOME OF A SERIES OF CONTACTS BETWEEN THE\nTWO COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  IN OCTOBER, IT WAS AGREED TO\nESTABLISH CONSULAR RELATIONS.  AIR LINKS BETWEEN BUENOS AIRES AND\nLONDON RESUMED A FEW WEEKS AGO.  A PARTY OF BRITISH MPS AND PROMINENT\nPUBLIC FIGURES HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM BUENOS AIRES AFTER THE\nINAUGURAL FLIGHT BY BRITISH AIRWAYS.  AN OBSTACLE TO THE RESUMPTION OF\nRELATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WAS THE ARGENTINE REFUSAL TO DECLARE\nTHAT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE AT AN END.  HOWEVER,\nTHE NEWLY-ELECTED ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MADE CLEAR LAST YEAR THAT SUCH\nHOSTILITIES COULD NOW BE CONSIDERED AT AN END.  BRITAIN, AFTER TALKS\nLAST OCTOBER, AGREED TO RAISE NO OBSTACLES TO ARGENTINE EFFORTS TO\nESTABLISH CLOSER TRADING RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE\nARGENTINE ECONOMY IS NOW SEEN TO BE IN A SEVERE PLIGHT.  PRESIDENT\nMENEM HAS WATCHED HIS POPULARITY DECLINE AS ARGENTINA INFLATION HAS\nREMAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL.\n\n   BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A DIRECT COMMUNICATION\nLINK BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  THE PURPOSE IS TO\nREDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCIDENTS AND TO LIMIT THEIR CONSEQUENCES IF\nSUCH INCIDENTS SHOULD OCCUR.  ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THIS HOTLINE\nWILL INCREASE COMMON KNOWLEDGE OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH\nATLANTIC.  THE LINK WILL BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ARGENTINE AND\nBRITISH FOREIGN MINISTRIES.  BRITISH MINISTERS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT\nADEQUATE DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE FALKLANDS.\n\n   FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER TIMOTHY SAINSBURY RETURNED TO LONDON LAST\nWEEKEND AFTER A VISIT TO THE FALKLANDS WHERE HE REASSURED ISLANDERS\nTHERE WAS NO WEAKENING IN BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO THEIR DEFENCE.\n\n   FOREIGN SECRETARY DOUGLAS HURD TONIGHT DESCRIBED THE AGREEMENT WITH\nARGENTINA AS \"VERY SATISFACTORY\" AND THAT IT \"UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT\nWE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH ARGENTINA\".  HE SAID: \"THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED\nWITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE OF SOVEREIGNTY.  I HOPE IT IS A TURNING POINT\nTHAT WILL LEAD TO A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA.\"\nMR HURD TOLD REPORTERS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE: \"I HOPE THAT TRADE\nBETWEEN BRITAIN AND ARGENTINA CAN BE ACCELERATED.  IT IS FOR THE\nFALKLAND ISLANDERS TO DECIDE ON THEIR OWN CONTACTS WITH THE MAINLAND.\"\n\n   ASKED IF THE INSTABILITY IN ARGENTINA MIGHT LEAD TO A NEW ATTEMPT\nTO SEIZE THE FALKLANDS, HE SAID: \"I THINK THAT IS BECOMING LESS AND\nLESS LIKELY.\"  HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION THAT THE READINESS OF THE\nGOVERNMENT IN ARGENTINA TO MAKE THIS ADVANCE WHICH BRITAIN HAD\nRECIPROCATED.  \"THE OUTCOME IS VERY SATISFACTORY,\" HE SAID.  THE\nBRITISH PROTECTION ZONE HAD BEEN REPLACED \"WITH SOMETHING FROM A\nSECURITY POINT OF VIEW THAT IS BETTER.  WE HAVE REPLACED IT WITH AN\nADVANCE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM ON THE APPROACH OF SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT.\nTHAT FROM A SECURITY VIEWPOINT IS AN IMPROVEMENT.\"  HE HOPED THAT THE\nAGREEMENT WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN THE FALKLANDS AND NOTED THAT THE\nFALKLAND ISLANDERS HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AN ASSURANCE OF BRITAIN'S\nCONTINUED COMMITMENT.\n\n   THE EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS AND THE ENDING OF VISAS WOULD TAKE\nPLACE QUITE SOON.\n\n   ASKED IF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS COULD EVER BE DISCUSSED WITH\nARGENTINA HE SAID: \"I DO NOT SEE HOW THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED BY US GIVEN\nTHE HISTORY AND PRINCIPLE THAT IS INVOLVED.\"\n\n   LABOUR WELCOMED THE MOVE TO RESUME FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  MR\nGEORGE FOULKES, A FRONT BENCH SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SAID IT\nMEANT THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE NOW ALMOST BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE\nPOSITIONS BEFORE THE 1982 CONFLICT.  BUT HE ADDED: \"WE MUST NOW PULL\nOUT ALL THE STOPS IN DEVELOPING TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO\nCOUNTRIES.\"  THIS INCLUDED CONSIDERING ALL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH\nINVESTMENT IN ARGENTINA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL, SPORTING AND\nOTHER LINKS.

(THERE IS $60 MILLION FOR\nREPRESSION).  BARELY RECUPERATED FROM HIS SURPRISE, THE FOREIGN\nMINISTER SAID THAT THE U.S. HELP IS A \"BILATERAL ISSUE AND,\nCONSEQUENTLY, IT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED\" AT THE CARTAGENA\nSUMMIT.  THE INTERIOR MINISTER, WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE\nOF SITUATION, DID NOT ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MCAFEE'S STATEMENT AND\nSTRESSED THAT \"MORE EXACT FIGURES WILL BE MENTIONED AT THE CARTAGENA\nSUMMIT.\"  WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH?  WILL THE CARTAGENA SUMMIT ADDRESS\nTHE ECONOMIC AID?\n\n   AFTER THIS PECULIAR SITUATION, THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO HAVE\nCHOSEN INTERDICTION AND ERADICATION -- REPRESSION -- TO FIGHT DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.

THIS STRATEGY LENDS ITSELF TO\nINTERVENTIONIST MILITARY POLICIES, SIMILAR TO THE PRESENCE OF U.S.\nMARINES IN BOLIVIA IN THE PAST, OR, IN THE FUTURE, THE CREATION OF A\nMULTINATIONAL MILITARY FORCE THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE REGIONAL POLITICAL\nAND MILITARY STABILITY.\n\n   WHEN THE TRAFFICKING OF COCAINE WAS CARRIED OUT AS A COVERT\nOPERATION (1984-87) INVOLVING THE CIA AND THE U.S. ARMY -- FOR THE\nPURPOSE OF PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE CONTRAS -- COCAINE\nTRAFFICKING WAS NOT A CRIME.  THE LINKS BETWEEN NORIEGA AND DRUG\nTRAFFICKING WERE A MATTER OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE AS LONG AS HE\nPROVIDED INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA.  BUT\nNOW THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT MIND INVADING PANAMA OR TURNING\nCOLOMBIA INTO AN INFERNO TO CAPTURE NORIEGA OR SOME OF THE MAJOR\nCOLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS ON THIS CRUSADE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THAT\nIS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DOUBLE-FACED MORALITY.\n\n   ANOTHER SCANDAL HIT U.S. SOCIETY LAST WEEK.  MARION BARRY, THE\nMAYOR OF WASHINGTON, THE CAPITAL OF THE EMPIRE AND ALSO THE CAPITAL OF\nCRIME, WAS CAUGHT IN AN FBI TRAP.  HE WAS FILMED CONSUMING COCAINE.\nHIS FOLLOWERS CLAIM THAT IT IS A WHITE CONSPIRACY TO PREVENT A BLACK\nMAYOR FROM RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TERM.\n\n   BUT THE INTERESTING POINT FOR US IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN\nBENNETT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STRATEGIST FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING (THE BENNETT PLAN), AND WASHINGTON POLICE CHIEF FULWOOD.\nWHILE BENNETT HAS QUESTIONED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WASHINGTON POLICE,\nCLAIMING THAT THIS AREA RECEIVES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SUPPORT\nFOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FULWOOD HAS SAID THAT\nBENNETT IS WASTING TIME \"TALKING WITHOUT DOING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING\"\n(NEWSWEEK, 29 JANUARY).  THE NEWSWEEK JOURNALIST SAID THAT EVEN BEFORE\nTHE BARRY SCANDAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE BENNETT PLAN HAD\nBECOME \"ONLY A DIRTY BATTLE OF WORDS.\"  BENNETT'S STRATEGY FOR THE\nPREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN\nA TOTAL FAILURE.  BENNETT THEREFORE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO\nCOVER HIS FAILURE IS TO TURN TOWARD LATIN AMERICA TO RELIEVE THE FURY\nOF HIS IMPOTENCE, ORDERING WARSHIPS AND PLANES TO CONTROL MARITIME AND\nAIR TRAFFIC.  AS USUAL, THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE \"BACKYARD\" HAVE TO\nPAY FOR THE MISTAKES OF U.S. POLICY.\n\n   THIS IS NOT A STORY OF SUSPENSE.  THE SUSPENSE HAS BEEN CREATED BY\nTHE ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO KNOW THE\nCONCLUSIONS OF THE SANTA CRUZ SUMMIT.  OTHERWISE WE WILL HAVE TO\nACCEPT THAT A SMOKE SCREEN HAS BEEN DEPLOYED OVER THE CARTAGENA\nSUMMIT.

IT HAS TO INVEST THOSE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY MAY\nYIELD SOMETHING.  WHERE?  IN POLAND?  IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA?  WHY?  WHY\nNOT IN LATIN AMERICA?

PRESIDENT, WHAT ABOUT THE PEASANTS OF PERU AND BOLIVIA?\nCOLOMBIA'S CASE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE COCA IS PROCESSED HERE.  WOULD\nTHE PEASANTS BE WILLING TO CHANGE THOSE CROPS FOR OTHERS?\n\n   [GARCIA] IF THEY ARE GIVEN A LONG-TERM GUARANTEE, YES.\n\n   [AMAT] BUT WOULD THEY CHANGE COCA FOR TOMATOES, ORANGES, AND CACAO?\n\n   [GARCIA] IT IS NOT EASY TO CHANGE IT FOR COFFEE, TOBACCO, CACAO,\nANNATTO, OR PALM TREES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS STUDIED ALL THIS.\nI HAVE A 600-PAGE REPORT FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT DISCUSSES THE\nALTERNATIVES FOR REPLACING THE 80,000 HECTARES IN THE GUAYAGA VALLEY\n-- WHICH IS THE LARGEST COCA-PRODUCING AREA IN THE COUNTRY.  IT\nWOULD COST $600 MILLION TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE AREA ON A LONG-TERM\nBASIS.\n\n   [AMAT] BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, COCA PRACTICALLY GROWS WILD; IT DOES NOT\nREQUIRE MUCH WORK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HOW CAN A GOVERNMENT LIKE YOURS\nCONVINCE A FARMER TO INVEST MUCH MORE MONEY IN A PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE\nMUCH LESS PROFITABLE?\n\n   [REPORTER] LET ME ADD SOMETHING TO THAT...\n\n   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] EXCUSE ME.  IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE.  THE\nPEASANT PRODUCES COCA BECAUSE HE HAS NO MONEY.  I WILL NOT ASK HIM TO\nINVEST MONEY HE DOES NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE PRODUCT.  THE UNITED\nSTATES HAS TO BUY THE NEW PRODUCT TO ACHIEVE THIS.  THE UNITED STATES\nHAS TO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BUY THE PRODUCT.  LOOK, HOW MANY\nTRILLIONS DOES THE UNITED STATES BUY AS IMPORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES? A\nFRACTION OF THIS WOULD CHANGE THE DESTINY OF COLOMBIA, PERU, AND\nBOLIVIA.\n\n   THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SAY: IF I BUY $600 BILLION IN PRODUCTS\nABROAD, I WILL BUY $10 BILLION -- OF ANYTHING -- IN PERU, COLOMBIA,\nAND BOLIVIA.

THEY WERE WAITING FOR A SHIPMENT OF\n400 \"WASP\" CLUSTER BOMBS PRODUCED BY FERRIMAR [EXPANSION UNKNOWN] -- A\nSUBSIDIARY OF FAMAE (ARMY ORDNANCE) -- AND BOUND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST.\nTHE DESTINATION OF THE SHIPMENT WAS IRAN. THE USERS: THE ARMED FORCES\nOF IMAM RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI.\n\n   THE SECRET SHIPMENT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS ON LAND.\n\n   THE FIVE CREW MEMBERS MADE A DECISION THAT NIGHT, TAKING ON FUEL\nAND FOOD AND FLEEING TOWARD PANAMA. IN THE DARK NO ONE NOTICED THE\nSHIP'S DEPARTURE, NOT THE SHIPPING COMPANY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE\nSHIP NOR THE PORT'S CAPTAIN -- A NAVY OFFICER WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO\nAUTHORIZE THE MOVE. THE JENKA LEFT AN UNPAID DEBT OF $30,000 OWED TO\nTHE SHIPPING COMPANY.\n\n   THE CASE WAS REPORTED BY THE PRESS AND FERRIMAR RUSHED TO SAY THAT\nIT WAS SELLING WEAPONS TO PAKISTAN AND NIGERIA. IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT, FOR ETHICAL REASONS, WOULD NOT ALLOW THE ENTERPRISE TO\nOFFER THE \"WASP\" BOMBS TO IRAN. IN FACT, CHILEAN BUSINESSMAN CARLOS\nCARDOEN WAS ALREADY SELLING \"CLUSTERS\" [PRECEDING WORD IN ENGLISH] TO\nIRAQ. DOING BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TWO SIDES CONFRONTING EACH\nOTHER IN THE LONG PERSIAN GULF WAR WAS NOT CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.\n\n   THE DEAL, HOWEVER, WAS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MILLIONS\nOF DOLLARS IN PROFITS. COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL AND THE USSR WERE KNOWN\nTO BE SELLING WEAPONS TO BOTH IRAN AND IRAQ. THE USSR WAS DIRECTLY\nSELLING WEAPONS TO IRAQ AND SUPPLYING IRAN THROUGH MIDDLEMEN. CHILE\nKNEW OF A SIMILAR EXAMPLE: DURING THE BEAGLE CHANNEL CONFLICT, WHICH\nALMOST ENDED IN A WAR WITH ARGENTINA, ISRAEL SOLD MISSILES TO BOTH\nSIDES.\n\n   THEREFORE, IN A CAREFULLY PLANNED OPERATION, FERRIMAR AND FAMAE\nWERE ABLE TO SELL CLUSTER BOMBS TO IRAN.\n\n   THE MIDDLEMAN WOULD BE FRENCHMAN BERNARD STROIAZZO, THE SAME PERSON\nWHO THREE YEARS LATER WOULD CAUSE THE \"IRAN-CORFO\" [PRODUCTION\nDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION] SCANDAL (HOY, NO. 655).\n\n   IT IS ONLY NOW THAT STROIAZZO'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. AN\nENGINEER HIRED BY IRAN'S NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY, HE SERVED AS A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF FERRIMAR AND FAMAE TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE\nSALE OF CLUSTER BOMBS IN 1986. AFTER TWO SHIPMENTS OF DEFECTIVE BOMBS,\nTHE IRANIANS DECIDED THAT THEY COULD CAUSE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG THEIR\nOWN MEN THAN AMONG ENEMY TROOPS. STROIAZZO WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE FOR 18\nMONTHS.\n\n   HE MANAGED TO LEAVE AND TRAVELED TO CHILE. WITH THE HELP OF CNI\n[NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER] DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL HUGO SALAS,\nHE CONTACTED CORFO OFFICIALS WHO HELPED HIM ARRANGE COMPENSATION. HE\nARRANGED A PRELIMINARY ACCORD FOR ESTABLISHING A TOXIC WASTE RECYCLING\nPLANT IN CHILE, BUT THE DEAL FAILED. HE THEN FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST\nCORFO IN THE 19TH CIVIL COURT OF SANTIAGO.  CORFO HAS NOT YET BEEN\nNOTIFIED OF THE LAWSUIT. THE PROBLEM, AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE TOXIC\nWASTE PLANT IS CONCERNED, WILL BE INHERITED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT --\nWHICH WILL TAKE OVER ON 11 MARCH -- AND BY CORFO.\n\n   DID FERRIMAR LIE TO THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT?\n\n   THIS ENTERPRISE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GOOD CONTACTS WITH THE\nAUTHORITIES. AMONG THE PARTNERS OF FERRIMAR OWNER ALDO PESCE WERE\nRETIRED GENERAL MANUEL CONTRERAS SEPULVEDA, FORMER CHIEF OF THE\nNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, DINA; GENERAL RAUL REYES, FAMAE\nDIRECTOR, AND COLONEL CARLOS CARRENO, WHO WAS A FAMAE EXECUTIVE AND AN\nADVISER TO FERRIMAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE \"WASP\" BOMBS. (A LAWSUIT\nFILED WITH THE 14TH CRIMINAL COURT OF SANTIAGO UNDER \"ROBBERY OF\nINDUSTRIAL SECRETS\" CHARGES CLAIMS THAT THE BOMBS WERE BUILT WITH\nPLANS STOLEN FROM CARLOS CARDOEN BY ONE OF CARDOEN'S TRUSTED MEN.)\n\n   TO EXPORT ITS BOMBS, FERRIMAR NEEDED THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE\nDEFENSE AND FOREIGN MINISTRIES.

BACK IN 1586, THE \"JEWEL OF THE CARIBBEAN\"\nWAS CAPTURED BY SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, WHO DID NOT BURN THE CITY TO THE\nGROUND ONLY BECAUSE HE RECEIVED A RANSOM OF 10 MILLION PESOS.  A\nCENTURY LATER CARTAGENA WAS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH.  FINALLY, IN 1741,\nTHE CITY'S DEFENDERS SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT OFF AN ASSAULT BY A HOST OF\n27,000 PIRATES HEADED BY SIR EDWARD VERNON...\n\n   THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBED THE MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS OF\nTHE UNITED STATES, BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, AND PERU HELD A FEW DAYS AGO IN\nCARTAGENA AS A KIND OF ASSAULT.  DESPITE SOME EXAGGERATION, THIS\nGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION WAS BASED ON PERFECTLY SERIOUS GROUNDS.  AFTER\nALL, THE CONFERENCE DID DISCUSS IMMEDIATE TASKS AND EVEN A DETAILED\nSCHEDULE FOR A JOINT OFFENSIVE BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES\nAGAINST CRIMINAL DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH RANKS FIRST IN THE PECKING\nORDER OF CRIME.\n\n   IT IS INDEED NECESSARY TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT AGAINST THE DRUG\nMAFIA'S STRONGHOLDS, WHETHER IN MEDELLIN, \"FAMOUS\" FOR UNBRIDLED\nGANGSTERISM, OR IN CARTAGENA ITSELF, WHOSE STATUS AS A RESORT IS\nTHREATENED BY THE SELFSAME \"COCAINE BARONS.\"  AS A MATTER OF FACT,\nTHIS TOURIST CENTER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS BY THE\nEXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS IN THE \"HILTON\" HOTEL, IN\nSTORES, OR AT ITS MARINAS.  IT IS NO WONDER, AS REUTER REPORTS, THAT\nNOT A SINGLE CRUISE SHIP HAS DROPPED ANCHOR THERE THIS SEASON.\n\n   YES, THE SITUATION IS HIGHLY ALARMING, AND THIS APPLIES TO THE\nWHOLE OF COLOMBIA AND EVEN TO THE ENTIRE REGION.  IN THESE CONDITIONS\nTHE FIRM RESOLVE DISPLAYED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CARTAGENA\nMEETING DESERVES UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT: THE RESOLVE TO FINALLY\nPOOL THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND TO\nJOINTLY PLACE A RELIABLE BARRIER IN ITS PATH.  THESE ARE THE\nINTENTIONS SHOWN IN THE JOINT STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOUR PRESIDENTS\nAND BY THE SERIES OF SPECIAL DOCUMENTS.\n\n   THE AIM OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS NOBLE INDEED: TO BESIEGE THE DRUG\nMAFIA IN ITS NESTS, TO CUT OFF THE \"LAUNDERING\" OF DRUG DOLLARS, AND\nTO DEPRIVE THE MERCHANTS OF \"SLOW DEATH\" OF BROAD ACCESS TO THE \"BLACK\nMARKET\" IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LION'S\nSHARE OF SOUTH AMERICA'S POISONOUS EXPORT IS CONSUMED.  IN OTHER\nWORDS, AN IMPORTANT STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN TO COMBAT ONE OF THE MAIN\n\"EVILS OF THE 20TH CENTURY,\" AND IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THE\nMEETING'S RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY APPRAISED BY UN SECRETARY GENERAL J.\nPEREZ DE CUELLAR.\n\n   HERE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION: EMPHASIS IN CARTAGENA WAS PLACED ON\nADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICE MEASURES AND ON WASHINGTON'S PRIMARILY\nMILITARIZED FORMS OF COOPERATION WITH THE ANDEAN STATES, BUT DOES THIS\nCONFORM WITH THEIR LONG-TERM NATIONAL INTERESTS, WITH THEIR DESIRE TO\nPUT AN END TO BACKWARDNESS AND ATTAIN A QUALITATIVELY NEW LEVEL OF\nSOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?  AFTER ALL, A RADICAL SOLUTION OF THE DRUG\nPROBLEM PRIMARILY DEMANDS NEITHER COMBAT AIRCRAFT NOT ARMORED\nPERSONNEL CARRIERS, BUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.  IT IS NECESSARY TO\nCHANGE THE ECONOMIC PROFILE OF VAST PROVINCES WHERE THE CULTIVATION OF\nCOCA AND MARIJUANA IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE POPULATION'S EXISTENCE.\n\n   TRUE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW EXPRESSED READINESS TO\nASSIST ALSO IN THIS SPHERE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS AN ALMOST\nTOTAL LACK OF READINESS TO IMPORT FROM SOUTH AMERICA THE CROPS WHICH\nCOULD, IN PRINCIPLE, SQUEEZE OUT COCA AND MARIJUANA.  IT WAS NOT FOR\nNOTHING THAT COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO, THE WHITE HOUSE'S\nCLOSEST ALLY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS, WAS FORCED TO DECLARE IN\nCARTAGENA THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RIGID PROTECTIONIST MEASURES ARE\nJEOPARDIZING THE VERY FUTURE OF \"ALTERNATIVE\" SECTORS OF TROPICAL CROP\nFARMING -- THE CULTIVATION OF COFFEE, FLOWERS, AND SUGAR CANE.  AND SO\nTHE \"SENIOR PARTNER\" APPEARS TO BE TIGHTENING WITH THE ONE HAND THE\nVISE IN WHICH THE DRUG MAFIA NOW FINDS ITSELF, WHILE USING THE OTHER\nHAND TO PROTECT ITS MARKET FROM LEGAL LATIN AMERICAN EXPORTS.\n\n   FINALLY, THE LAST BUT, I THINK, MOST SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT.\nACTUALLY, IT ALSO CASTS AN UNFAVORABLE LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF CONSISTENT\nFIGHTER AGAINST THE DRUG MAFIA WHICH WASHINGTON HAS NOW ASSUMED.  THIS\nARGUMENT IS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATED IN JUST ONE SHORT WORD: \"PANAMA.\"\nINDEED, DID THE RECENT AGGRESSION AGAINST THIS SOVEREIGN STATE, ONE OF\nWHOSE MAIN MOTIVES WAS ACTUALLY \"TO PUNISH THE DRUG BUSINESS BOSSES,\"\nNOT DEMONSTRATE ALL THE FLAWS OF WASHINGTON'S \"STRONGARM APPROACH\"\nTOWARD LATIN AMERICA?  AND ARE THERE ANY GUARANTEES THAT THE PENTAGON\nWILL NOT START \"COPYING\" ITS PANAMANIAN EXPERIENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES\nIN THE CONTINENT ON THE PRETEXT OF PURSUING THE \"COCAINE BARONS\"?\n\n   THESE ARE FAR FROM RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, AND IT IS A PITY THAT\nCARTAGENA SIMPLY FAILED TO PROVIDE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLEAR-CUT\nANSWERS TO THEM.

OUR POSITION IS\nBASED ON PRINCIPLES, ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE NOT CONTINUE TO\nSUFFER THE VIOLENCE GENERATED BY FMLN TERRORISM.  THUS, THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MET, REGARDLESS OF THE ELECTIONS.  OBVIOUSLY,\nI BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS WILL AFFECT THE FMLN\nIN SOME MEASURES, AND THIS COULD INCLUDE... [CHANGES THOUGHT] I DO NOT\nKNOW.  WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT POSITION THEY WILL TAKE IN THE\nFUTURE, BUT IT COULD BE.  OBVIOUSLY A CHANGE HAS OCCURRED AND WILL\nHAVE AN IMPACT AND COULD MOVE THE FMLN TO CHANGE ITS POSITION.

THE ARMED FORCES OF A\nCOUNTRY SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND TO THE GOVERNMENT\nTHAT IS LEGITIMATELY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.  AND THEREFORE, THIS WOULD\nCURTAIL THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE IN TRYING TO\nCONTROL AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FROM THE\nPOSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY.  SECONDLY, I THINK THAT I\nHAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION THAT\nWILL CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH\nNICARAGUA, BUT RATHER THE ATTITUDE OF THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH\nRESPECT TO AID TO THE FMLN, TO THE MARXIST GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.\nAND IN THIS CASE WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHANGE TAKING PLACE.\nOBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THAT WITH MRS CHAMORRO AS PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA\nTHAT THIS AID WILL STOP AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE\nRESUMPTION OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA, BUT\nIT IS THAT ATTITUDE THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE\nRESULT IN ITSELF.\n\n   WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT IF MRS\nCHAMORRO REALLY IS IN CONTROL, IN TOTAL CONTROL, ESPECIALLY OF THE\nSANDINISTA ARMY, THAT THERE WILL BE A STOP IN AID, AND THEREFORE THE\nFMLN WOULD NOT HAVE NICARAGUA'S LOGISTICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR\nTHEM.  AND THEREFORE, THIS CERTAINLY AFFECTS THEM.\n\n   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] I THINK THAT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO OR TWO WEEKS\nAGO IN THE WASHINGTON POST THERE WAS A REPORT THAT COLONEL BENAVIDES\nWAS LIVING A RATHER LUXURIOUS LIFE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN\nTHAT PIECE.  AND ALSO THE U.S. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM WALKER HAS SAID THAT\nHE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME THAT, WELL, THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THERE\nWAS SOME PRESSURE, OR THERE WAS SOME PROTECTION COMING FROM THE\nTANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] TO PROTECT BENAVIDES, BECAUSE HE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] THEIR MEN AND THAT SOME LOWER LIEUTENANTS WERE NOT\nGOING TO BE RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROTECTION AND THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE\nTHE FAULT FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  AND ALSO WILLIAM WALKER HAD SAID\nTHAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TANDONA TO\nSTEP DOWN AND FOR OTHER OFFICERS TO MOVE UP.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT\nTHAT [WORD INDISTINCT]?  SHOULD THERE BE THAT KIND OF PRESSURE?\nSHOULD SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE TANDONA STEP DOWN FROM THEIR POSTS?\n\n   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE\nDETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER YOU BELONG TO A SPECIFIC GRADUATING CLASS\nWITHIN THE ARMED FORCES THAT SHOULD BE WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU\nCONTINUE OR NOT, OR BE REMOVED OR NOT FROM THE ARMED FORCES.  IT IS\nYOUR OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE THE\nDETERMINING FACTOR.\n\n   SO, THEREFORE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE TANDONA PEOPLE, JUST\nFOR BEING MEMBERS OF THE GRADUATING CLASS, [CHUCKLES] THAT ACTION\nSHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM.  SO I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE THAT IS\nNOT REALLY THE POINT.\n\n   WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CASE, I THINK IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF\nTHE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ON HOW IT GOES, WHAT TYPE OF\nDEFENSE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARRAIGNED HAVE.  I THINK THAT THEY ALL\nARE RECEIVING THE LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE CASE AND THE OTHER [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER, IN ENGLISH] AS FOR THE DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS,\nBEFORE YOU LEFT FOR TAIWAN YOU CONDITIONED THE DIALOGUE ON A CEASING\nOF ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  TO BE SPECIFIC, DOES THIS MEAN [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE?  AND ALSO, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT\nTHIS DIALOGUE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?\n\n   [CRISTIANI, IN ENGLISH] WELL, IF WE COULD TRY AND PUT INTO ONE\nBASKET AND CALL THAT BASKET WITH A NAME WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS,\nWE ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE TERRORIST\nACTIVITY IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  YOU JUST MENTIONED THE\nFACT ABOUT A POLE THAT THEY USE FOR ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE\nCOUNTRY.  JUST LAST NIGHT THEY BLEW UP ONE AND THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE\nHURT.  TWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE PASSING BY WERE HURT BY THAT EXPLOSION.\nSO THAT IS WHAT HAS TO STOP.  THE FMLN HAS TO STOP ALL TERRORIST\nACTIVITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT HURTS THE CIVILIAN\nPOPULATION.  THAT IS NOT MILITARY ACTIVITY.  THAT IS SOMETHING GEARED\nAGAINST OR TO CONFRONT THE ARMED FORCES.  SO IT IS THAT VIOLENCE THAT\nCAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT IS CALLED TERRORISM THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR --\nTHOSE ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY AFFECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF THE\nCOUNTRY.

THE\nFOREIGN MINISTER AND MYSELF EXPRESSED OUR APOLOGIES TO THE PERUVIAN\nGOVERNMENT FOR ANY INCONVENIENCES OR INSECURITY FELT BY ITS PERSONNEL.\n\n   [ENDARA] THESE ARE VERY REGRETFUL INCIDENTS.  NOT ONLY A BASIC\nCOURTESY OF CIVILIZED PEOPLE, THAT IS TO RESPECT THE RESIDENCES OF\nOTHER PEOPLE, AND MORE SO WHEN THEY BELONG TO REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER\nCOUNTRIES, BUT A PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN VIOLATED.\nTHAT PRINCIPLE IS DUE RESPECT FOR DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.\n\n   WHAT REALLY WORRIES US ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IS A REPORT GIVEN TO US\nBY THE ORGANIZERS OF DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE EMBASSY.  SPECIFICALLY, BY\nTHE WIDOWS OF MEN MURDERED BY THOSE WHO ARE REFUGED IN THAT EMBASSY;\nTHE WIDOW OF MAJOR GIROLDI WAS HERE, AND SHE TOLD US THAT ALL HER\nACTIONS AT THE EMBASSY HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL.\n\n   SHE TOLD US THAT TODAY THEY NOTICED THAT TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE\nWERE PRESENT AND THESE PEOPLE PROVOKED THE VIOLENCE; THEY INSTIGATED\nTHE VIOLENCE.  OBVIOUSLY, THERE CERTAIN GROUPS ARE SEEKING TO SPOIL\nOUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY.  THEY WANT TO PREVENT THE\nESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WITH JUSTICE AND LIBERTY AT ALL\nCOSTS.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT THIS INCIDENT MUST BE DENOUNCED BEFORE THE ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF THE NATION.  HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THESE PROVOCATIONS.\nNEVERTHELESS, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH URGES THE CITIZENS TO NOT ALLOW\nPEOPLE TO PROVOKE THEM INTO PARTICIPATING IN VIOLENT ACTIONS SUCH AS\nONE WHICH OCCURRED TODAY.  THE CITIZENS MUST NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO\nEXPLOIT THE FEELINGS THAT ALL PANAMNIANS FEEL TOWARDS CRIMINALS AND\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND WHO ARE HOLED UP IN EMBASSIES\nSUCH AS THIS ONE; WE URGE CITIZENS TO AVOID BEING PROVOKED.

THE GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES REACTED BY REJECTING U.S.\nMILITARY AID.  THE SAME POSITION WAS ADOPTED, AMID VERY SIMILAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, BY THE MILITARY GOVERNMENTS OF JORGE VIDELA IN\nARGENTINA AND AUGUSTO PINOCHET IN CHILE.\n\n   RELATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALA AND WASHINGTON CONTINUED TO BE TORTUOUS\nDURING THE BALANCE OF THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION AND ONLY IMPROVED,\nRELATIVELY SPEAKING, WHEN REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN TOOK OFFICE IN\n1981.  HOWEVER, ONLY YEARS LATER -- WITH THE COMMITMENT TO\nDEMOCRATIZATION BY DE FACTO MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT LED THE COUNTRY\nFROM 1982 AND 1985 -- WAS THERE A CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE BETWEEN\nGUATEMALA AND THE UNITED STATES THAT BROUGHT ABOUT QUITE HARMONIOUS\nRELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AND PRESIDENTS\nREAGAN AND BUSH UNTIL MID-1989.\n\n   ON 27 FEBRUARY U.S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS STROOK CRITICIZED THE\nGUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' FAILURE TO PURSUE THE AUTHORS OF MURDERS AND\nOF KIDNAPPINGS OF POLITICAL, STUDENT, AND LABOR LEADERS, AND THUS\nWORSENED AN ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION THAT HAD RESURFACED ABOUT SIX\nMONTHS AGO WHEN AMBASSADOR STROOK, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA,\nOBJECTED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF COLONEL HUGO MORAN CARRANZA, FORMER\nDIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL, TO THE POST OF MANAGER OF THE\nSANTO TOMAS DE CASTILLA PORT ENTERPRISE.  THE AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED HIS\nOBJECTION BY CLAIMING THAT ASPECTS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL DRUG\nTRAFFICKING HAD TO BE RESOLVED FIRST.\n\n   ON 6 MARCH, PRESIDENT CEREZO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD\nHARDENED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE GUATEMALAN REGIME AND THAT THIS\nATTITUDE CONTRASTS WITH A TOLERANT POSTURE EXHIBITED TOWARD PREVIOUS\nADMINISTRATIONS IN GUATEMALA:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] THEY HAVE HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE COURTS\nSITUATION.  THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND AS A\nRESULT OF THE UN ACTION A DRAFT PROCEDURAL LAW WILL BE SUBMITTED.\nTHIS SHOULD BE APPROVED AND PROCEEDINGS SHOULD IMPROVE IN GUATEMALA IN\nABOUT [WORD INDISTINCT] YEARS.\n\n   HOWEVER, WE ARE DEALING WITH LONG-TERM EFFORT.  WE HAVE MADE\nINSTITUTIONAL CHANGES FOR ONLY FOUR YEARS.  I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT\nTHE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD A COUNTRY THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO MOVE\nFORWARD IS UNFAIR AND OVERLY CRITICAL.  IT IS BEING MORE CRITICAL OF\nTHE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT THAN IT EVER WAS TOWARD PAST\nDICTATORSHIPS.  THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY HARSHER IN\nCRITICIZING THE CURRENT GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nDEMOCRACY THAN PAST DICTATORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TO WHICH THE UNITED\nSTATES, IN CERTAIN CASES, WAS AN ACCOMPLICE BY SAYING NOTHING [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].  [END RECORDING]\n\n   ONLY HOURS AFTER THE PRESIDENT MADE THESE STATEMENTS, THE U.S.\nEMBASSY IN GUATEMALA ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT IF THE UNITED\nSTATES ABSTAINED FROM VOICING ITS CONCERN OVER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, IT\nWOULD INDEED BE ACTING AS AN ACCOMPLICE.  THE COMMUNIQUE CITES\nSTATEMENTS MADE ON 5 MARCH IN WASHINGTON BY STATE DEPARTMENT\nSPOKESWOMAN MARGARET TUTWILLER THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR STROOK, IN HIS\nCAPACITY AS PRESIDENT BUSH'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, HAS ON MANY\nOCCASIONS TOLD TOP GUATEMALAN OFFICIALS, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THAT\nTHOSE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS MUST BE TURNED OVER TO JUSTICE.\n\n   STROOK IS CURRENTLY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE WAS RECALLED BY THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSULTATIONS.  ACCORDING TO THE DIPLOMATIC\nMISSION, THE AMBASSADOR'S STATEMENTS ACCURATELY REFLECT THE PERMANENT\nU.S. POSITION OF CONSIDERING HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE\nTREATED AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

THE FPMR WAS ALSO IN\nTHE NEWS WITH THE UNSUCCESSFUL 7 SEPTEMBER 1986 ATTACK ON CHILE'S\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE, GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET, WHICH CLAIMED THE LIVES OF\nFIVE OF PINOCHET'S BODYGUARDS.\n\n   AYLWIN ALSO STATED THAT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH\nBOLIVIA \"IS BLOCKED BY THE BOLIVIAN DECISION TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH\nOUR COUNTRY.\"  COMMENTING ON BOLIVIA'S ASPIRATION FOR AN OUTLET TO THE\nSEA, AYLWIN SAID: \"WE CANNOT ACCEPT CONDITIONS FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT\nOF RELATIONS.

FIRST\nOF ALL, WE RESPECT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL OPTIONS.

WE BEGAN WITH THREE BASIC TENETS: A\nMULTIPARTY SYSTEM, A MIXED ECONOMY, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE.\n\n   EXERCISING THIS RIGHT, WE SAID: THIS IS THE PATH.  AND THE UNITED\nSTATES SAID: THAT IS NOT THE PATH.  TIGHTLY CLINGING TO ITS\nIMPERIALISTIC POLICY, THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO DESTROY THE\nNICARAGUAN REVOLUTION AND ORGANIZED A MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND\nECONOMIC ONSLAUGHT.\n\n   YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS STORY AND ITS TRAGIC TOLL OF 60,000\nVICTIMS.\n\n   WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND NICARAGUA AND THE GAINS ATTAINED BY THE\nREVOLUTION, BECAUSE THIS DEFENSE WAS HEADED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE\nWHO, ARMED WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND COURAGE, TOOK UP WEAPONS TO\nDEFEND THEIR HOMELAND'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.

IF THE COUNTERREVOLUTION IS NOT\nDISARMED, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HAVE TO CONFRONT THE\nCOUNTERREVOLUTION, AND WE WILL FIGHT AS WE NEVER DID BEFORE.\n\n   THE UNITED STATES LIFTED THE EMBARGO AND OFFERED AID TO NICARAGUA.\nWE WILL NOT BE LIKE RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO SABOTAGE ECONOMIC\nEFFORTS.  RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED TO A CERTAIN PARTY, BUT TO\nALL OF THE PEOPLE.

I MUST THANK THIS HEROIC AND EXEMPLARY CHILE FOR THE\nMANNER IN WHICH IT HAS DISPLAYED ITS FONDNESS FOR THE NICARAGUAN\nPEOPLE THROUGH ME, AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE\nSOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM, SOVEREIGNTY,\nDEMOCRACY, AND INDEPENDENCE IS INDISPENSABLE.\n\n   THE FUTURE, IT IS SAID, BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE PRESENT\nAND THE PAST ALSO BELONG TO THEM.  THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE REFRESHED,\nIT SHOULD BE WATERED WITH FRESH RAIN; ONLY THEN WILL THE TREES TURN\nGREEN AND THE FLOWERS BLOOM, ONLY THEN WILL THE REVOLUTIONARY\nPROCESSES BE UNDERSTOOD.  WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS AND HOURS, BUT THIS\nIS NOT THE TIME TO TALK.

WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE AND\nMOST URGENT THING TO DO?\n\n   [LLOREDA] JUAN, I BELIEVE THAT SECURITY IS NO LONGER AN ACADEMIC\nISSUE; IT HAS BECOME AN ANGUISHED NEED FOR COLOMBIA.  THIS WILL\nPROBABLY MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE MANY SACRIFICES IF WE WANT TO\nPUT A STOP TO VIOLENCE WITHIN A FEW YEARS.  IN FACT, WE WILL HAVE TO\nSACRIFICE SOME OF THE BROAD AND GENEROUS FREEDOM WE HAVE ALWAYS\nENJOYED IN THIS COUNTRY.  GIVEN THESE DEPLORABLE ACTIONS, THE SECURITY\nISSUE HAS BECOME A PRIORITY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT LIVE IN A SOCIETY IN\nWHICH ITS MEMBERS ARE CONTINUOUSLY THREATENED.  THIS NOT ONLY REFERS\nTO DR. JARAMILLO OSSA'S DEATH, BUT ALSO TO OTHER DEATHS THAT SOMETIMES\nDO NOT APPEAR WHERE THEY SHOULD, MEANING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE\nNEWSPAPERS.\n\n   A WEEK OR TWO AGO THE POLICE SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD AN AVERAGE OF 54\nVIOLENT DEATHS PER DAY SO FAR THIS YEAR.  IF THIS CONTINUES, WE WILL\nHAVE MORE THAN 12,000 MURDERS IN COLOMBIA BY THE TIME PRESIDENT BARCO\nTURNS OVER POWER ON 7 AUGUST.  I BELIEVE, AND I THINK YOU SHARE THE\nSAME VIEWPOINT, THAT WE HAVE A WORLD RECORD FOR INSECURITY AND\nVIOLENCE.  THEREFORE, WE CANNOT TAKE THE RISK OF ALLOWING THE PROCESS\nOF MORAL COLLAPSE AND THE STATE OF INSECURITY THAT PREVAILS IN THE\nCOUNTRY TO CONTINUE.\n\n   WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE STATE SO THAT IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY COUNTER\nVIOLENCE.  THE PLEBISCITE AND THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY I HAVE BEEN\nPROPOSING INCLUDES THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO HAVE EFFICIENT\nINSTRUMENTS TO COUNTER VIOLENT ACTIONS.  THIS IS NOT, LIKE I SAID IN\nTHE BEGINNING, AN ACADEMIC ISSUE; AND IT IS NOT A PROPOSAL PRESENTED\nBY IDEALISTIC YOUTHS.  IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF A NATION THAT COULD\nDISAPPEAR OR LOSE ITS FREEDOMS AND DEMOCRACY, IF WE DO NOT ACT\nDECISIVELY AND RESOLUTELY.

[CESAR] GAVIRIA -- REGARDLESS OF THE 27 MAY ELECTORAL\nRESULTS, WE MUST REACH A PATRIOTIC AGREEMENT.  WE CAN NOW DO IT IN\nHOMAGE TO BERNARDO JARAMILLO SO THAT THE IDEA OF A PLEBISCITE IS\nSPONSORED.  THUS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A THOROUGH INSTITUTIONAL\nREORGANIZATION.  WE MUST SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT COLOMBIA, RATHER\nTHAN ELECTORAL LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN\nOFFER SOLUTIONS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE\nARE NOW LOOKING TO THEIR FUTURE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR.\n\n   [REPORTER] THANK YOU, DR.

IS THIS TRUE?\nIS THERE A DANGER THAT VENEZUELA COULD BECOME AN OPERATIONAL BASE FOR THE\nCOCAINE MAFIA?  IS IT TRUE THAT HEAVY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED NEAR\nTHE BORDER AND OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, WITH MONEY OF WHICH NO ONE KNOWS\nTHE SOURCE?  WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CONTROL THIS FLOW OF CAPITAL?\n\n   [IBEDACA] I SHARE THIS CONCERN.  IT IS VERY SIMPLE: WHEN YOU ARE IN\nA BUILDING OR A HOUSE AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE,\nTHIS OF COURSE DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOU BECAUSE OF THE UNREST, BECAUSE\nTHERE MIGHT BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION WHERE FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT\nHAVE TO TESTIFY.\n\n   IBEDACA THUS BEGINS HIS EXPLANATIONS WITH A SIMPLE,\nEASY-TO-UNDERSTAND DOMESTIC ANALOGY.  HE ADMITS THAT VENEZUELA \"IS IN\nA SITUATION THAT SHOULD REALLY CATCH OUR ATTENTION, BECAUSE VENEZUELA\nBORDERS COLOMBIA AND WE KNOW THAT COCA IS PRODUCED MAINLY IN BOLIVIA,\nPERU, ECUADOR, AND IS PROCESSED IN COLOMBIA.  COLOMBIA IS AMERICA'S\nGREAT COCAINE LABORATORY.  DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE RECENTLY SUFFERED\nHARD SETBACKS THROUGH RECENT ACTIONS BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMY AND\nNATIONAL POLICE IN WHICH THE HEADS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN\nKILLED AND GREAT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND COCAINE AND A NUMBER OF\nAIRPLANES HAVE BEEN SEIZED.  TO TRANSPORT WHAT IS LEFT, THEY WILL, OF\nCOURSE, HAVE TO LOOK FOR A BETTER PLACE AND THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE\nSEVERAL VULNERABILITIES.\"\n\n   [OJEDA] LIKE WHAT?\n\n   [IBEDACA] THE EXTENSIVE BORDER, THE PLAINS NEAR IT WITH CLANDESTINE\nLANDING STRIPS; THE PROXIMITY TO EASY-TO-USE PORTS AND AIRPORTS.\nTHROUGH THE ANTIDRUG TRAFFICKING SERVICES AND TOGETHER WITH THE DISIP\n[DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE AND PREVENTION SERVICES] AND THE\nMETROPOLITAN POLICE, WE HAVE A PLAN AND WE HAVE TAKEN DEFINITE ACTIONS\nTO FIGHT IT.  AWARE OF THIS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF\nINVESTMENT CONTROLS IN THESE STATES NEAR COLOMBIA.  WE ARE RECEIVING\nREPORTS OF PROPERTY REGISTRATIONS, BUT WE NEED TO TAKE MORE EFFECTIVE\nMEASURES, BECAUSE WE NEED GREATER CONTROL AND SUPERVISION IN THIS\nAREA, ESPECIALLY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS.\n\n   IN 1986, THREE YEARS AFTER THE DRUG LAW WENT INTO EFFECT, THE GN'S\nANTIDRUG DIVISION MADE A RECORD CONFISCATION OF 29,698 KILOS OF\nMARIJUANA (NEARLY 30 TONS), A FIGURE THAT DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN\n1988, AND INCREASED IN 1989.\n\n   SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED BY GENERAL GERMAN SEPULVEDA SIERRA, THIS\nOFFICE HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING AND PLANNING ACTIONS THAT\nTHE GN DEVELOPS AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS LIMITED BY\nTHE DRUG LAW AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE TRIBUNALS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE\nFILES MUST BE TURNED OVER TO THE JUDICIAL TECHNICAL POLICE [PTJ].\n\n   IT IS CURRENTLY CALLED THE DIRECTORATE OF THE SERVICES AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING AND IS DIRECTED BY BRIGADIER GENERAL RAMON GUILLEN DAVILA,\nWHO ALSO AGREED TO TALK TO EL NACIONAL.\n\n   [GUILLEN] THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS HAS BEEN A JOB OF THE GN DURING\nALL OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I HAVE BEEN IN IT SINCE I WAS A SUBLIEUTENANT.\nNOW IT IS CALLED THE \"MODERN CRIME\" AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT WARS\nTO FIGHT.\n\n   [OJEDA] PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT WAR, THE BIG COLOMBIAN\nTRAFFICKERS HAVE PROPOSED TO THEIR COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT FORMULAS TO\nACHIEVE PEACE AND RETIRE FROM THE DRUG BUSINESS.  ARE THESE PROPOSALS\nFROM THE DRUG CARTELS SINCERE?  WE ASKED THE GENERAL.\n\n   [GUILLEN] I THINK THAT IT IS ONLY A STRATEGY TO GAIN TIME AND SEEK\nTHEIR OWN SOLUTIONS.  IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT THEY ARE PRETENDING TO\nTURN VENEZUELA INTO AN \"OPERATIONAL BASE.\"  THERE IS DEMOCRACY AND\nLIBERTY OF MOVEMENT AND INVESTMENT HERE.  IN JUST SAN ANTONIO DEL\nTACHIRA, THERE ARE 76 EXCHANGE HOUSES AND ONLY ONE MEETS THE\nREQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW.

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WILL\nMEDIATE A MEETING IN CARACAS BETWEEN SALVADORAN REBELS AND A\nGOVERNMENT DELEGATION.  CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN GUATEMALAN\nGUERRILLAS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION\nCOMMISSION WILL ALSO BE HELD IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL, OSLO.\n\n   LISTEN WHAT OUR COMMENTATOR LEONID LEVCHEKO HAS TO SAY:\n\n   THESE TWO MEETINGS HAVE ONE POINT IN COMMON: BOTH HAVE BEEN MADE\nPOSSIBLE THANKS TO THE INITIATIVE AND THE MEDIATION OF THE MOST\nDIVERSE CIRCLES, WHICH ARE INTERESTED IN PUTTING OUT THE FIRE IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA.  THE CARACAS MEETING COINCIDES WITH THE START TODAY\nOF THE OFFICIAL VISIT BY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI.\n\n   VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, WHO WELCOMED\nCRISTIANI, HAS ALREADY HELD TALKS WITH THE SALVADORAN REBELS\nDELEGATION.\n\n   THE VENEZUELAN CHIEF OF STATE WILL ACT AS MEDIATOR IN THE DIALOGUE\nBETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS WHEN THEY SIT AT THE\nNEGOTIATING TABLE.  THE OSLO MEETING WAS CONCEIVED AT THE INITIATIVE\nOF THE LUTHERAN AND CATHOLIC CHURCHES.  THIS IS A BIG ADVANCE IF ONE\nCONSIDERS THAT THE FIRST AND LAST DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE\nGUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 1987 IN\nSPAIN.  THEY WERE THEN SUSPENDED AND NEVER RESUMED.\n\n   [PASSAGE INDISTINCT] BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ADVANCE TOWARD\nNATIONAL RECONCILIATION IN ALL THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL\nAMERICAN CONFLICT.  BEFORE THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN 1967\nBY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, MANY INTERNATIONAL FORCES, WHICH\nHINDERED A SOLUTION, WERE INVOLVED IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.\n\n   THE MILITARY CHIEFS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA ALSO REJECTED THE\nNEGOTIATION PROCESS, ASSUMING THAT THEY COULD DEFEAT THE REBEL\nMOVEMENT.  IN FACT, DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR MORE THAN 70,000\nPEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN EL SALVADOR AND IN NEARLY 30 YEARS OF\nCONFLICT IN GUATEMALA MORE THAN 100,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED.\n\n   IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FRATRICIDAL WAR IS ABSURD BOTH IN EL\nSALVADOR AND IN GUATEMALA.  IT IS TIME THAT, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF\nNICARAGUA, OTHER COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO RESTORE PEACE IN THE AREA.\nTHIS IS WHY THE REPORTS COMING FROM CARACAS AND OSLO HAVE BEEN GREETED\nWITH GREAT INTEREST.  IT IS CLEAR THAT A JUST SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA IF ONLY THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE\nSTRICTLY FOLLOWED AND THE COUNTRIES' SOVEREIGNTY IS RESPECTED BY NOT\nMEDDLING IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES.\n\n   THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOVIET VIEW ON CENTRAL AMERICA.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-1198 (SYNCHRONETICS / UMD)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   NO CITY, NO DATE (FBIS) -- [TEXT] BOGOTA DOMESTIC SERVICE IN SPANISH AT\n0230 GMT BEGINS TO BROADCAST LIVE OR RECORDED A SPEECH BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO\nBARCO VARGAS FROM THE NARINO PALACE IN BOGOTA.
