HE HAS SAID\nTHAT THE DEATH SQUADS APPEARED IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF THE\nFARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].

WE SPENT EIGHT OR\nNINE YEARS FIGHTING THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND JOSE\nNAPOLEON DUARTE.  WE REMEMBER [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ASSASSINATION OF\nHERBERT ANAYA SANABRIA.  HOWEVER, WHEN DUARTE DIED, A COMMUNIQUE WAS\nISSUED DECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT THE FUNERAL COULD TAKE PLACE\nPEACEFULLY.  HOW SHOULD WE VIEW ALL OF THESE APPARENT CHANGES OF\nPOSITION BY THE FMLN?\n\n   [SANCHO] AS FOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT\nADDITION TO BEING A POLITICAL FORCE, THE FMLN HAS HUMAN SENSITIVITY.\nWE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE THIS HUMANE ACTION BY\nDECLARING A TRUCE SO THAT MR. DUARTE COULD BE BURIED.  WE ALSO HAVE TO\nMENTION THAT THE PDC AND ALL OF THE LEFTIST FORCES OF THE COUNTRY CAN\nCONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEPOLARIZATION OF SOCIETY.  THE TRUCE WAS A\nGESTURE, IT WAS TO MAKE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE\nTO DEPOLARIZE SOCIETY AND THAT EACH OF US CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.\n\n   THAT IS WHY WE INSIST THAT ONE MUST NOT RETURN TO ONE'S ELECTORAL\nOR POLITICAL HEGEMONIC PLANS, BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT THE UNITY OF\nTHE PEOPLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE FASCISTS.\n\n   [REPORTER] COMMANDER, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE LEGISLATIVE\nASSEMBLY WHEN DUARTE DIED BECAUSE THE PDC LEGISLATORS MOTIONED TO NAME\nHIM THE FATHER OF DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN THESE TWO POLITICIANS?\n\n   [SANCHO] WE BELIEVE THAT DUARTE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY.  HE\nHAD HIS OWN BELIEFS, HE HAD HIS OWN PERSONALITY, AND HE REALLY HAD\nCHARISMA; WE CANNOT DENY THAT.  OF COURSE, WE CANNOT COMPARE HIM TO A\nCRIMINAL WHO IS BEING SOUGHT BY JUSTICE.  I WOULD SAY THAT D'AUBUISSON\nIS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE, WHO HAS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM HIS IMMUNITY\nAS A DEPUTY.  HIS IMMUNITY AS A DEPUTY DOES NOT PRECLUDE HIS CRIMES.\nTHERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DUARTE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHO IS\nWELL-KNOWN, BUT IS VIOLENT AND UNPOPULAR.\n\n   [REPORTER] TO END THE FIRST PART OF THE INTERVIEW, ARE YOU\nOPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONCERTED EFFORT BY POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC\nFORCES IN THE COUNTRY OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH WILL GO HIS OWN WAY.\nARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A CONCERTED EFFORT?\n\n   [SANCHO] A CONCERTED EFFORT IN A POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF ALL THE\nFORCES IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT\nMUST BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL NECESSITY FOR THE UNITY OF ALL POPULAR AND\nNATIONAL SECTORS, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY FORMULA TO REBUILD\nTHE COUNTRY, TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY, AND TO RECONCILE THE COUNTRY.\nTHIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A CONCERTED POLITICAL EFFORT.  I BELIEVE\nTHERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FOR CONCERTED\nPOLITICAL EFFORTS, WHICH WILL REALLY GIVE NEW HOPE TO THE LARGE\nMAJORITY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

PRESIDENT, YOUR REPLIES TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS HAVE\nALREADY ANSWERED MY FIRST QUESTION.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU\nSOMETHING, HOWEVER.  NOW THAT THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS ABOUT TO START,\nTHE TWO SIDES HAVE APPARENTLY HARDENED THEIR POSITIONS.  THE FMLN\nCOMMANDERS HAVE SAID THAT, TO END THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR, THERE MUST\nBE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF INJUSTICE AND LACK OF DEMOCRACY.  THE\nMINISTER OF JUSTICE, IN TURN, SAID RECENTLY THAT THE FMLN MUST RETURN\nTO CIVILIAN LIFE AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO NEGOTIATE.  I WOULD LIKE\nTO KNOW WHAT WILL BE NEGOTIATED AND WHAT WILL BE DONE TO END THE WAR\nTHROUGH A DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN.\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I AM SURPRISED BY THE REMARKS THAT YOU ARE ATTRIBUTING\nTO DR. SANTAMARIA, BECAUSE HE IS VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT WHAT HAS\nHAPPENED SO FAR.  HE IS VERY MUCH AWARE THAT THERE IS POINT TWO OF THE\nGENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH NOTES THAT POLITICAL AGREEMENTS MUST BE\nREACHED IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO ARMED CONFRONTATION AND THE VIOLENCE\nTHAT IS AFFECTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE WILL\nBE A PROCESS FOR DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION, REFERRED TO AS THE\nTOTAL SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE AGREEMENT.  I BELIEVE THAT IT\nIS A MATTER OF REACHING AGREEMENTS.  WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, ARE INVOLVED\nIN THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THE SUFFERING OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE\nBELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THEM TO LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF VIOLENCE\nIN WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY KILLED, SO MUCH DESTRUCTION, AND SO MANY\nPROBLEMS.\n\n   AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALWAYS ASKED: WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS\nBARRING THEIR RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE?  THEY ARE THE ONLY GROUP\nTHAT HAS NOT JOINED THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WHAT DO THEY\nWANT?  LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING REASONABLE THAT CAN BE DONE.\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER ALL THAT\nCOULD FOSTER OR CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN OUR COUNTRY.  WE\nBELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEMS. I CANNOT SEE ANY HARDENING BY\nTHE GOVERNMENT.  I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN FLEXIBLE.  WE HAVE SAID THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING AS ITS OWN ANY CONSENSUS\nREACHED BY THE PARTIES.  IN OTHER WORDS, AT LEAST YOUR REMARK ON THE\nGOVERNMENT IS NOT TRUE.  I REPEAT, PERHAPS IN THE STYLE OF THE\nPREVIOUS QUESTION, THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO BE BIASED.  IN DUE TIME, WE\nWILL SEE WHETHER THE FMLN HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN INFLEXIBLE OR HARDENED\nOR WHATEVER.  IT WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THE FMLN'S PROPOSALS ARE\nREASONABLE OR NOT.\n\n   [MODERATOR] PABLO YACU OF [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [YACU] MR. PRESIDENT, CONCERNING THE ECONOMY, SOME OF THE\nOPPOSITION POLITICIANS I TALKED WITH OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE TOLD\nME THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED.  THEY THINK THAT, BECAUSE\nDIFFICULTIES HAVE ARISEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW SITUATION IN THE\nCOUNTRY, AND BECAUSE THE VOLUME OF THE U.S. AID HAS DIMINISHED, THE\nCOUNTRY IS RAPIDLY TAKING STEPS THAT OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES\nHAVE ALREADY TAKEN, TO MEET WITH THE SO-CALLED CONSULTING GROUP FORMED\nBY THE LEADING WORLD CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AND REQUEST LARGE LOANS TO\nSTABILIZE THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.  THESE POLITICIANS TOLD ME THAT\nTHEY ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS WOULD IMPOSE A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE NEW\nGOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD ASSUME OFFICE AFTER 1994.\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS SHOULD TRY TO\nUNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE MEASURES, WHICH CERTAINLY ENTAIL A\nSACRIFICE FOR THE VARIOUS NATIONAL SECTORS, ARE RESPONSIBLY TAKEN\nBECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  MANY PEOPLE\nWILL SAY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO THIS OR THAT.  I WOULD ONLY LOOK AT\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT THE\nDESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE CAUSED BY AN IRREGULAR FORCE, SUCH AS THE\nFMLN, HAVE EXPERIENCED MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAN THOSE\nENCOUNTERED BY EL SALVADOR AT PRESENT.

FRANKLY, AS I SAID, THIS CASE IS NOW IN\nTHE HANDS OF THE COURT.  THE JUDGE IS THE ONE WHO CAN ORDER FUTURE\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CASE.  YOUR QUESTIONS RELATE TO DOUBTS AND\nCONCERNS THAT THE JUDGE HAS BEFORE HIM.  HE CAN SUMMON ANYONE TO\nTESTIFY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS ALREADY SUMMONED SOME TOP OFFICERS.\n\n   I CAN ONLY SAY THIS: YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED A MEETING IN WHICH\nSUPPOSEDLY I WAS PRESENT.  YOU ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS AT THAT MEETING\nTHAT THE MURDER WAS PLANNED.  THERE IS MUCH SPECULATION, THEREFORE I\nTHINK THAT WE MUST REMAIN COOL-HEADED.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE\nSPECULATING WHEN THEY SAY THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, THIS COULD HAVE\nHAPPENED, OR THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME HAVE\nSAID THAT THERE IS A COVER UP, BUT COLONEL RIVAS HIMSELF WAS THE ONE\nWHO DISCOVERED WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME.\n\n   THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS, WHICH IS NATURAL.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT\nMEAN THAT ...[CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR EXAMPLE, I MADE A STATEMENT FOR THE\nPROGRAM \"60 MINUTES;\" I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, BUT\nOBVIOUSLY MY REPLIES WERE NOT AIRED FOR SOME REASON.  HOWEVER, I SAID\nTHAT IT IS NO SECRET IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE,\nA GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHO FEEL THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SOME OF\nTHE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE IN FACT LINKED TO THE FMLN.  THEREFORE, IN\nTHIS CASE, ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT WOULD HAVE\nTO BE INVESTIGATED.  WOULD THAT BE CALLED FOR?  WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT\nIS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON SPECULATION.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, DURING THE INVESTIGATIONS -- CONDUCTED BY THE\nINVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION OF CRIMINAL ACTIONS, AN AUXILIARY LEGAL ORGAN\n-- WE THOUGHT IT WAS CONVENIENT AT A GIVEN TIME, SINCE WE HAD ENOUGH\nEVIDENCE ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE BELIEVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, THAT THE\nCASE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.\n\n   THEREFORE, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TODAY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE\nCASE AND DECIDES WHETHER TO INTERROGATE SOMEONE OR NOT.  IF THERE IS\nANY DOUBT, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN ORDER THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE\nTHIS OR THAT.  WHETHER SOMEONE IS INTERROGATED BY A JUDGE OR BY THE\nCOMMISSION IS IRRELEVANT; THE JUDGE MUST DECIDE.  I BELIEVE THAT IN\nTHIS CASE THE JUDGE SHOULD INVESTIGATE.  AS I SAID BEFORE, I THINK\nTHAT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HONOR COMMISSION\nWILL BE SUMMONED, AND THAT ANOTHER MAY BE SUMMONED AFTERWARD.\n\n   [REPORTER] COULD YOU TELL US IN ENGLISH.  YOU SAID THAT YOU DO NOT THINK\nTHAT IT IS NECESSARY, THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE JESUITS, AND IF\nYOU ARE GOING TO START INVESTIGATING PEOPLE, WHY NOT INVESTIGATE EVERYONE\nWHO HAS CRITICIZED THE JESUITS.  THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT NOT\nEVERYBODY IS IN A POSITION TO REPROVE THE JESUITS, NOT EVERYONE WAS IN THE\nMILITARY HIERARCHY, NOT EVERYONE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ALTO MANDO [PRECEDING\nWORDS IN SPANISH].  THERE ARE [WORD INDISTINCT] PEOPLE IN THE ALTO MANDO WHO\nARE KNOWN TO HATE THE JESUITS, WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CRITICIZED THEM IN THE\nPAST.  WHY DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO BE\nINVESTIGATED DIRECTLY?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OFFICERS\nIN THE ARMED FORCES AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, WHETHER LATELY OR EARLIER, THAT\nTHERE WAS A WIDESPREAD BELIEF OF SOME SORT OF PARTICIPATION BY THE\n...[CORRECTS HIMSELF] SOME OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS WITH THE FMLN.  THIS IS NOT\nFOR US AT THIS POINT AND TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE.  IT IS\nSIMPLY SOMETHING THAT WAS BELIEVED OUT THERE, AND THEREFORE, IT IS UP TO THE\nJUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL ONLY INTERVIEW ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED THIS,\nOR WHETHER HE IS GOING TO INTERVIEW MANY PEOPLE.\n\n   THERE HAS BEEN ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WELL COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACT\nOF THE FMLN, THE ACT OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS.  THERE WERE ALSO\nSPECULATIONS AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSASSINATION WAS COMMITTED AS\nTO WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME.  SO THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT\nCOULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME, AND THEREFORE, THERE COULD BE OTHERS\nTHAT WE COULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE [WORD INDISTINCT] INVESTIGATING.  BUT,\nI THINK IT IS ALL UP TO THE JUDGE NOW [TO DECIDE] WHO WILL HE CALL TO\nTESTIFY, WHO WILL HE CALL TO INTERROGATE, AND IF HE FINDS ANY NEED, HE\nHAS ALL THE POWER TO INSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATIVE UNIT TO FOLLOW THROUGH\nON ANYTHING THAT HE REACHES.  IT IS NOT UP TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH RIGHT\nNOW TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO COME UP WITH TESTIMONY WITH THE JUDGE.\nIT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE.

YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GO BY THAT AS A WAY TO SIMPLY STATE THAT\nHIS STATEMENTS ARE TRUE.\n\n   IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT WHEREAS BEFORE NO ONE REALLY\nWOULD BELIEVE COL.

MY POINT IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEBATED\nPUBLICLY; THAT ANYBODY -- COL. OCHOA, MEMBERS OF THE JESUIT COMMUNITY,\nOR ANYBODY ELSE -- WHO HAS ANY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL\nSHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE AND GIVE HIM THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT\nWOULD BE HELPING THE PROCESS AND NOT MERE SPECULATIONS IN PUBLIC.\n\n   WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA, WE DISCUSSED THIS\nWITH ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF MRS. CHAMORRO DURING OUR VISIT AND WE\nDECIDED TO INITIATE [32-SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION] PLANS AND,\nTHEREFORE, WE ARE WILLING TO REINITIATE THE PROCESS.  HER ADVISER WAS\nVERY CLEAR TO STATE THAT THEY WILL BY NO MEANS AID THE FMLN IN THAT\nRESPECT.\n\n   WE THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN THE 25TH OF FEBRUARY\nAND THE 25TH OF APRIL IS THAT THE FMLN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET\nALL THAT WAS LEFT IN NICARAGUA....[CORRECTS HIMSELF) OUT OF NICARAGUA\nBECAUSE THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEMS THEY WOULD FACE WITH THE NEW\nGOVERNMENT, AND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER GO ABOUT FREELY IN NICARAGUA\nWITH THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR LOGISTIC SUPPORT.  THEREFORE, THEY HAVE\nBEEN TRYING TO BRING THEM IN.  IN THAT CASE THERE WAS A GROUP OF FMLN\nMEMBERS WHO WERE DETAINED IN HONDURAS WITH THE HELP OF THE HONDURAN\nAUTHORITIES, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHIPPING WEAPONS BY\nLAND THROUGH HONDURAN TERRITORY, BUT THAT GROUP WAS DETAINED.\n\n   [MODERATOR, IN SPANISH] THANK YOU, MR.

IN ACCORDANCE\nWITH THE LAW, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE\nSO THAT THE M-19 AND THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES CAN CARRY ON THEIR\nCAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE FULLY SUPPORTED THE\nARMY, THE POLICE, THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY], AND\nALL OF THE AUTHORITIES CHARGED WITH MAINTAINING ORDER.  THESE AGENCIES\nARE AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO\nCARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES EFFICIENTLY.\n\n   AT THIS TIME, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO OVERLOOK THE RESULTS ACHIEVED\nIN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIOLENT ONES AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS\nACHIEVED.  I UNDERSTAND THE IMPATIENCE AND THE DESIRE FOR DEFINITIVE\nRESULTS AGAINST NOT ONLY DRUG TRAFFICKING BUT ALL OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF\nVIOLENCE AS WELL.\n\n   I WILL NOW MENTION SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT COMPLEMENT THOSE THAT\nHAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF\nA HIGH-LEVEL COMMISSION, IN WHICH THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE\nREPRESENTED, TO FOLLOW UP THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO ASSESS THE\nSECURITY MEASURES THAT THE PUBLIC FORCE AND THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS\nHAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOR ALL CANDIDATES.  THIS COMMISSION CAN BY ITSELF\nPROPOSE NEW MEASURES TO REINFORCE THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES IN VARIOUS\nAREAS.  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF\nSECURITY WILL MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THE POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGNS TO CONSIDER THE EXISTING PROTECTION MEASURES.  THE\nCOMMISSION MET WITH THE M-19 AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY AND WILL\nMEET WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE\nPROTECTION FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO\nWORK TO REDUCE THE RISK OF EACH OF THE CANDIDATES TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL.\nFOR THIS REASON, THE GOVERMENT WILL REVISE THE EXISTING SITUATION\nREGARDING MOBILIZATION AND LOCATION OF THE CANDIDATES.  ALSO, THE\nGOVERNMENT WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF ELITE POLICEMEN, WHO HAVE\nDEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTERRORISM AND THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  THE 1ST ARMY DIVISION\nCOMMANDER HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE SPECIFIC TASK OF COORDINATING ALL\nFORCES, SECURITY AGENCIES, AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE MEDELLIN\nAREA.\n\n   THE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ENCOURAGED A BROAD,\nPARTICIPATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS.  TWO YEARS AGO, THE\nGOVERNMENT PROPOSED A PLEBISCITE AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS A\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BILL.  IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT\nINTERPRETED THE NATIONAL FEELING, WHICH DEMANDS A MORE EFFICIENT\nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND EVEN MORE STRINGENT ANTITERRORIST\nMEASURES, FOR WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  THE\nGOVERNMENT ALSO ECHOED THE PEOPLE'S CALL FOR STRONGER INSTITUTIONS AND\nA MORE EFFICIENT AND REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS.  COLOMBIANS KNOW THAT\nTHE CURRENT EVILS WILL BE DEFINITIVELY OVERCOME BY EXPANDING AND\nSTRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY EVEN FURTHER, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR\nTHE CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISIONS THAT CONCERN THEM MOST.\n\n   I WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO DO\nEVEYTHING NECESSARY SO THAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS WE CAN PAVE THE WAY\nFOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.

IT ALSO SEEKS TO WEAKEN THE STATE AND\nMAKE COLOMBIANS LOSE FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  HOWEVER, THOSE\nWHO FOMENT VIOLENCE WILL NOT MANAGE TO WEAKEN A STRONG DEMOCRACY THAT\nIS SUPPORTED BY ALL COLOMBIANS OR TO DESTROY THE PATH OF PEACE THAT WE\nHAVE BUILT AFTER SO MANY DIFFICULTIES.\n\n   TWO OF THESE DIFFICULTIES STEM BACK MORE THAN FIVE DECADES.  THE\nFIRST DIFFICULTY WAS TO BUILD AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE IN A COUNTRY\nWHERE THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE INHERITED FLARED UP IN THE FIFTIES, AND\nAFTER HAVING EVOLVED, IT HAS TAKEN ON DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS\nNARCO-TERRORISM AND BANDS OF HIRED ASSASSINS ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS OF\nTHE EXTREME RIGHT.\n\n   THE SECOND OBSTACLE, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE, IS THE LACK OF\nTOLERANCE FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM.  EVEN PROGRESSIVE IDEAS ARE MANY\nTIMES CONSIDERED DANGEROUS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COLD\nWAR IS OVER.  A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY IS NOT AFRAID OF COMMUNISM.  ON\nTHE CONTRARY, IT ACCEPTS COMMUNISM, BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT VIOLENCE,\nREGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE.  THE USE OF WEAPONS BOTH TO DEFEND AN\nIDEOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, IS UNACCEPTABLE IN A\nPLURALIST DEMOCRACY.\n\n   THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGIC MURDER OF CARLOS PIZARRO\nWILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN BEEN ACHIEVED, THAT IS, A\nCLEAR, VIABLE, AND DEFINED PATH TO PEACE.  THE OBLIGATION WE HAVE\nAHEAD OF US AND THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT UNITED IS TO KEEP THAT PATH OF\nPEACE OPEN.\n\n   ALL COLOMBIANS ADMIRE THE PEACE INITIATIVES OF THE M-19, AND WE\nSHARE THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES AND FOLLOWERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO,\nBECAUSE THEIR SADNESS AND ANGER IS SHARED BY ALL COLOMBIANS WHO LOVE\nPEACE.  FACTS SHOW THAT THE M-19 MEMBERS WISELY ADOPTED THE DECISION\nTO REJOIN DEMOCRACY AND REMAIN IN DEMOCRACY, TO STRUGGLE FOR PEACE,\nAND TO PROMOTE LEGALLY THE REFORMS THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY.\n\n   WHEN THEY ABANDONED THEIR WEAPONS, THEY DID NOT ABANDON THE\nSTRUGGLE FOR THEIR IDEALS.  THEY HAVE ALL THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY\nARE NO LONGER A GUERRILLA GROUP.  M-19 IS NOW A POLITICAL PARTY, WITH\nALL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF A POLITICAL PARTY AND WHOSE IDEAS SHOULD BE\nTOLERATED.  THOSE WHO, THROUGH VIOLENCE, ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE\nM-19 FLAG AND TO PREVENT ITS CANDIDATES FROM RUNNING IN THE ELECTIONS\nAND TO STOP THEM FROM CONDUCTING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, ARE NOT JUST\nTHE ENEMIES OF THAT MOVEMENT, THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PEACE.  THEY ARE\nTRYING TO DESTROY THE PATH THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE REINCORPORATION OF\nTHE GUERRILLA GROUPS INTO CIVILIAN LIFE.\n\n   THE MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AUTHORS OF CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER\nARE THE ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO SABOTAGE THE\nELECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION.\nTHE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ALLOW THE VOICE OF M-19 TO BE SILENCED.\nTHEREFORE, THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY REQUESTED AIRTIME ON TELEVISION SO\nTHAT ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, LEADER OF THAT PARTY, COULD EXPRESS HIS\nOPINIONS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.

TO REDUCE THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' BUDGET\nBY 50 PERCENT IS TANTAMOUNT TO DISMANTLING IT, AND I FOR ONE AM NOT\nWILLING TO MAKE THAT DECISION.  I AGREED TO TAKE THE CORRECT PATH AT\nTHE RIGHT MOMENT; TO REDIRECT THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES AND TO SEE\nTHEY ALSO ACT WITH AUSTERITY AND IN THE BEST NATIONAL INTEREST.\n\n   IT IS EASY TO CRITICIZE AND SAY THINGS, BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE HAD\nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THIS, NOTHING WAS DONE.

THE YAMALES CAMP IS INSIDE\nHONDURAN TERRITORY.  THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW ONUCA AND CIAV\n[INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT AND VERIFICATION] FORCES TO\nCONTROL THESE PERSONS.  ONCE MORE I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE\nPOSITION YOU ARE TAKING: WHY NOT SEE THINGS POSITIVELY?  INSTEAD OF\nSAYING WE HAD CONTRAS HERE FOR 10 YEARS, SAY THAT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE\nANY.  I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF OPTIMISM WE SHOULD IMPRESS UPON THE\nCOUNTRY.  LET US NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT YESTERDAY, INSTEAD BUILD ON\nTODAY'S REALITY.  I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS NEWS CONFERENCE\nAND TO BE ABLE TO TELL MY FELLOW CITIZENS AND YOU THAT NO LONGER ARE\nWE TO HAVE CONTRAS IN HONDURAS -- A POSITIVE STEP.

DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNTS YOU MAY BE RECEIVING IN\nTHE FUTURE, OR IS IT A QUESTION OF HAVING TO WAIT THERE WITH A LITTLE\nPAPER BAG TO THEN HAND IT OVER TO [CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT] DON RICARDO\nMADURO?  WHAT ARE THE RESOURCE FORECASTS AND WHAT DEFINITE INVESTMENT\nPLANS ARE THERE FOR THESE RESOURCES?  ONE MUST ESPECIALLY TAKE INTO\nACCOUNT THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON THE CENTRAL BANK CURRENCY\nRESERVES SINCE INFLATION CAN BE A TIME BOMB.  LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO\nASK YOU IF YOU....

GETTING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, THE\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE ARMED FORCES WAS ESTABLISHED\nTHIS WAY: THE 1989 BUDGET APPROVED BY CONGRESS WAS 150 MILLION\nLEMPIRAS.\n\n   [REPORTER] PERHAPS I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF CLEAR.  I WAS REFERRING TO\nTHE FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE ONCE LOANS WERE PAID OFF\nWITH THESE STOPGAP LOANS.\n\n   [CALLEJAS] YOU ARE RIGHT.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STOPGAP\nFINANCING FOR $247 MILLION.  THIS STOPGAP LOAN OPENS THE PATH SO THAT\nFRIENDLY COUNTRIES AND BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL FINANCIAL\nORGANIZATIONS CAN RESUME THEIR LOANS TO THE COUNTRY.  THESE FUNDS WILL\nGIVE US THE RIGHT TO DRAW ON SPECIAL IMF ACCOUNTS, FUNDS FROM SPECIAL\nWORLD BANK PROGRAMS SUCH AS SAL-1 AND SAL-2, OR FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN\nWITHHELD FROM JAPAN AND GERMANY.

THE PRECISE AMOUNTS WILL BE GIVEN BY THE\nCENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT; HOWEVER, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THE AMOUNT\nOF FUNDS TO BE RECEIVED WILL BE NO LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING LOANED,\nPLUS SOME SURPLUSES FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND FRIENDLY\nCOUNTRIES, WHICH HAVE WITHHELD THEIR LOANS OR DONATIONS BECAUSE OF\nHONDURAS' INELIGIBILITY WITH THE IMF.

THE SOLID-FUELED\nMISSILES CARRY THEIR FUEL (THAT BURNS) AND THE COMBURENT (THAT\nSUPPLIES THE OXYGEN TO TRIGGER THE COMBUSTION) ON A STICKY ROD, THE\nCOMBUSTION OF WHICH CANNOT BE REGULATED.  THE CAKE BURNS COMPLETELY\nONCE THE COMBUSTION STARTS.  THEREFORE, SOLID-FUELED MISSILES ARE\nDIFFICULT TO CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER.\nMOREOVER, THEY PUT UP WITH ROUGH HANDLING AND CAN BE EASILY FIRED.\nTHE MILITARY PREFER THIS TYPE FOR MANUFACTURING SHORT-RANGE MISSILES.\n\n   THE LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES CARRY THE FUEL AND THE COMBURENT IN\nCOMPLETELY SEPARATE TANKS.  THE TWO ELEMENTS MEET IN A COMBUSTION\nCHAMBER WHERE THEY IGNITE AFTER TRAVELLING THROUGH PIPES.  VALVES MAKE\nIT POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THE POWER OF THE ENGINE.  GROUND PERSONNEL ARE\nABLE TO STOP THE ENGINE AND RESTART IT IN FULL FLIGHT, IN SHORT, TO\nCONTROL THE MISSILE AS THEY WISH THROUGH RADIO MESSAGES.\n\n   THE CRYOGENIC-FUELED MISSILES WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE 70'S AND\n80'S.  THEY CARRY HYDROGEN AND LIQUID GAS WHICH ARE LIGHTER THAN ANY\nOTHER PROPELLANT ELEMENT BUT WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REFRIGERATE\nAND TO ISOLATE.  THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD VERY FAST\nVEHICLES BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO.\n\n   THEY ARE USED TO PLACE HUGE COMMUNICATION SATELLITES IN SPACE SOME\n36,000 KM ABOVE THE EQUATOR, OR TO ATTACK A CITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE\nOF THE WORLD.\n\n   LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES REPRESENT THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED DURING\nTHE 50'S AND 60'S AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, EXPLAINS SOVIET LEADERSHIP\nIN SPACE RESEARCH.  THESE OLD, HEAVY, CUMBERSOME, AND UNBREAKABLE\nMISSILES DO NOT HAVE FRAGILE EQUIPMENT AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PLACE\nCARGO INTO OUTER SPACE AT A REASONABLE COST.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE\nLARGE FAMILY OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN CRYOGENIC- FUELED MISSILES CONTINUE\nAT AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND ARE UNPREDICTABLE (AS THE CASE OF THE\nSPACE SHUTTLE AND THE ARIANE IV AND V).  MOREOVER, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY\nCOSTLY.\n\n   TOO POOR TO EVEN THINK OF DEVELOPING LIQUID-FUELED MISSILES, BRAZIL\nAND ARGENTINA HAVE TRIED TO PLACE SOLID-FUELED VEHICLES INTO ORBIT FOR\nDECADES.  THIS IS NOT ALL THAT EASY BECAUSE THESE MISSILES ARE REALLY\nLITTLE MORE THAN FLYING RODS [CANITAS VOLADORAS], BUT THE CASTOR,\nWHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY ARGENTINA IN 1978, THE SONDA IV DEVELOPED BY\nBRAZIL, AND THE JAPANESE LAUNCHING DEVICES DEVELOPED BY ISAS (A\nUNIVERSITY SPACE RESEARCH AGENCY) HAVE PROVED TO BE REASONABLY\nMANAGEABLE BEASTS.\n\n   THE CASTOR REPRESENTED THE PHASE PREVIOUS TO DESIGNING A SPACESHIP\nAND THIS MUST BE THE REASON WHY IT MYSTERIOUSLY DIED IN 1978 AFTER A\nSERIES OF INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TESTS AND AFTER HAVING ALLOWED US TO\nREACH AN AGREEMENT FOR A \"JOINT-VENTURE\" WITH THE FRG TO STUDY THE\nATMOSPHERE.  THE ABSENCE OF MISTAKES BY A DEBTOR COUNTRY MAY BE FATAL.\n\n   WHEN ARGENTINA ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO DISCREETLY THINK ABOUT OUTER\nSPACE (1982/83), IT ALREADY HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO CONSIDER LARGER\nPROJECTS.  IN FACT, WITH ITS ONE METER DIAMETER TUBE, THE CONDOR COULD\nPLACE A 200 KG CARGO IN A LOW POLAR ORBIT OF ONLY 200 KM.\n\n   THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ARGENTINA TO HAVE ONE OR MORE PAIRS\nOF EYES IN SPACE SO THAT COULD ASSESS ITS NATURAL RESOURCES, PREDICT\nTHE WATER FLOW OF RIVERS ON WHICH HYDROELECTRIC DAMS COULD BE BUILT,\nDETERMINE WHERE IT COULD FIND OIL AND URANIUM, AND CHEAPLY STOP\nILLEGAL FISHING ON THE CONTINENTAL PLATFORM.  THIS POSSIBILITY COULD\nNOT BE ACCEPTED BY SOME PEOPLE.\n\n   BRAZIL, WHICH IS LESS HARD UP, IS ABOUT TO PROGRESS FROM THE SONDA\nIV TO THE SONDA V AND HAS OPENLY INVITED US TO JOINTLY DEVELOP THE\nSPACESHIP.  WHAT WILL ARGENTINA ANSWER?  \"WE WILL\"?  OR WILL IT HAVE A\nCHAUVINIST ATTITUDE?  WHAT A PITY IT DID NOT ADOPT THAT ATTITUDE NOW\nTHAT IT IS LETTING THE CONDOR PROJECT DIE IN ITS FIRST STAGE -- IT WAS\nNEVER TESTED -- WHEN THE PRESSURE IS NOT AS GREAT AS IT HAS BEEN.\nWORST OF IT ALL IS THAT IT IS NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE.\n\n   VERY WELL THEN, IT IS ACCEPTED, THE CONDOR WILL GO NO FURTHER.\nWHAT IS LEFT?  VERY LITTLE.  SHOULD WE DEVELOP SATELLITES EXCLUSIVELY\nFOR SPACE RESEARCH TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE SUN, OR STUDY THE\nCOSMIC EXPLOSIONS OF X-RAYS.  THESE ISSUES, IF UNAFFECTED BY ECONOMIC\nAND POLITICAL FACTORS, DO NOT DISTURB ANYBODY.  THE NASA IS QUITE\nWILLING TO GIVE US ROOM, FREE OF CHARGE, ON THEIR ROCKETS FOR THIS\nTYPE OF SATELLITES.  THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL GAIN EITHER\nMONEY OR SPACE SOVEREIGNTY.  THERE IS NO NEED TO POINT OUT THAT ANY\nSIMILARITY BETWEEN THIS POSSIBILITY AND AN INDEPENDENT SPACE RESEARCH\nPROGRAM, SUCH AS BRAZIL'S, IS MERE COINCIDENCE.\n\n   IN THE 80'S ARGENTINA ALLOWED ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH AT THAT\nTIME WAS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE THIRD WORLD, TO BE HINDERED.  NOW IT\nIS ALLOWING ITS WINGS TO BE CLIPPED AND, WITH A STUPID SMILE, IS\nYIELDING EVERY ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE SOVEREIGNTY IN SPACE.  EACH ATTEMPT\nTO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY IS LABELLED ARMS ESCALATION BY THOSE CHAMPIONS\nOF PEACE, OUR CREDITORS.\n\n   IT IS QUITE TRUE, THE CONDOR II MAY BE A MISSILE, AS A CARGO\nAIRCRAFT MAY DROP BOMBS AND A TRUCK MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH ARTILLERY FOR\nWAR.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT ARGENTINA MUST STOP MANUFACTURING ALL TYPE\nOF VEHICLES?  THIS QUESTION IS NOT POINTLESS IN A COUNTRY THAT REFUSES\nTO MAKE ANY PROGRESS.

AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE\nCONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE.  SECOND, OBVIOUSLY\nTHE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE\nDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STANDBY WITH A WEAKENED\nDEFENSE.

IN GENERAL TERMS,\nWE DO BELIEVE PROGRESS WILL BE MADE AND THAT WE WILL ADVANCE QUITE\nRAPIDLY.\"\n\n   IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION REGARDING A LETTER FROM AN UNNAMED GROUP\nOF YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS ADVOCATING A PURGE OF THE MILITARY AND\nSUPPORTING CRITICISMS MADE BY FORMER ARMY COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA\nPEREZ, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS OR\nNOTES.  THE FACT THAT IT IS ANONYMOUS CASTS SOME DOUBT ON THE\nINTENTIONS BEHIND IT OR ABOUT THE GROUP THAT COULD BE SENDING IT.\nPOSING AS YOUNG OFFICERS IS EASY TO DO.  THIS COULD HAVE COME FROM THE\nFMLN -- MAKING AN ISSUE OF ALL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- OR\nFROM ANY OTHER GROUP.\"\n\n   REGARDING THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE REBELS' RECENT MILITARY\nOFFENSIVE, HE STATES: \"I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE\nTHAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO\nDATE....  I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE\nNEWS.  THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE\nTHAT THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES....  SOME OF THEM VIEW\nTHE DIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE\nTHAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY\nTHE FMLN.\"\n\n   TURNING TO RECENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CRITICISM CHARGING SLOWNESS IN\nTHE HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN\nTHE JESUIT MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE, I CANNOT\nSPEED UP, SLOW DOWN, OR ALTER THE JUDGE'S DECISIONS.  IN NO DEMOCRACY\nCAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DICTATE ORDERS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  THE\nSAME HAPPENS IN THE UNITED STATES AS IN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.\nI BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE -- ALTHOUGH THERE IS\nMUCH URGENCY IN SEEING THIS TRIAL COMPLETED; THERE ARE GREAT\nEXPECTATIONS -- THAT THE JUDGE IS DUTY BOUND TO CONTINUE WITH THE\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES STIPULATED BY SALVADORAN LAW.\"  HE POINTS OUT THAT\nTHE PROSECUTION OF GENERAL NORIEGA IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO TAKING\nA LONG TIME.\n\n   REGARDING A REPORTED FMLN ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN SAN SALVADOR\nYESTERDAY, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON WAS WHO\nREPORTED AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE, EITHER THE OFFICIAL\nOR THE PRIVATE ONE.  NEITHER OF THEM WAS ATTACKED, THOUGH THERE COULD\nHAVE BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT SUCH AN ATTACK WAS EXPECTED.  AN FMLN\nCOLUMN WAS DISPERSED IN AREAS CLOSE TO THE TWO RESIDENCES.\"\n\n   QUESTIONED ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF A POSSIBLE CUT IN U.S.\nGOVERNMENT AID TO EL SALVADOR, CRISTIANI RESPONDS:  \"WELL, I THINK THAT\nFIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECTS OF A REDUCTION OR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.\nFIRST, I THINK IT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE\nOBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END TO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE\nPROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED; AND THAT A CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY\nSOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING\nOF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY\nVICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO END THE\nCONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL DIALOGUE.  SECOND, OBVIOUSLY\nTHE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE\nDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND WILL NOT STANDBY WITH A WEAKENED\nDEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS REALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED\nFOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- SOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL\nPROGRAMS -- ...  FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES.\"\n\n   RETURNING THE JESUITS MURDER CASE, CRISTIANI IS ASKED IF THE MILITARY\nHIGH COMMAND IS BEING INVESTIGATED.  HE SAYS:  \"FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY\nTHAT THE HIGH COMMAND -- AND THIS IS JUST MY OWN POINT OF VIEW -- WAS\nINSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATION.  THE HIGH\nCOMMAND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION TO BE WITHIN THE ARMED\nFORCES, AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS NO PRECEDENT IN THE PAST WITH RESPECT TO\nINVESTIGATING MILITARY UNITS....

PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY THE FMLN CARRIED OUT DIFFERENT\nARMED ACTIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED\nBY THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND JUSTIFIED THE ACTIONS BECAUSE OF ALLEGED\nHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, REPRESSION, AND LACK OF SECURITY FOR\nCIVILIANS.  HOW DO YOU VIEW THESE ACTIONS JUST WHEN THE TALKS ARE\nABOUT TO BEGIN?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I READ THE COMMUNIQUE AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS\nONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FMLN COMMUNIQUES I HAVE SEEN TO DATE.  IT\nIS A JUSTIFICATION THAT IS NOT VERY JUSTIFIABLE, I WOULD SAY.  I\nBELIEVE THE EVENTS ON 1 MAY IN THE MORNING CAN CLEARLY BE UNDERSTOOD.\nALL GROUPS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE WERE ABLE TO MARCH PEACEFULLY.\nTHEIR FREEDOMS ARE NOT BEING REPRESSED. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE ALL HEARD\nAND SEEN WHAT THEY SAID AND DID AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.  I FEEL\nTHAT THIS WAS A WAY TO SEEK NOTORIETY THROUGH THE NEWS.  THIS COULD BE\nONE OF THE REASONS.  THE OTHER REASON COULD BE THAT THEY ARE HAVING\nPROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES.  WE HAVE INFORMATION TELLING US THAT THERE\nARE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE DIFFERENT GROUPS.  SOME OF THEM VIEW THE\nDIALOGUE AS SOMETHING SERIOUS, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT, AND IT COULD BE\nTHAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESULTING IN THESE IRRATIONAL ADVENTURES BY\nTHE FMLN.  I FEEL THAT AT THIS STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, THEIR\nACTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIABLE.  THAT IS NOT ALL.  THEY HAVE\nEVEN VIOLATED WHAT THEY HAVE CALLED UNILATERAL GESTURES MADE IN THE\nPAST.  THIS SHOWS THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS AND SINCERITY IN ALL OF\nTHEM, OR SOME OF THEM, CONCERNING THE OBJECTIVES WE ARE TRYING TO\nACHIEVE WITH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.\n\n   [CRISTIANI] GUILLERMO PENATE FROM EL DIARIO DE HOY.\n\n   [PENATE] THERE ARE SOME LABOR GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN\nTHE DELEGATION THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE TALKS WITH THE FMLN.\nCOULD THIS NOT BE SOME SORT OF DISADVANTAGE FOR THE OFFICIAL\nDELEGATION, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE GROUPS COULD GAIN STRENGTH?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I THINK THAT IS TRUE.  SOME GROUPS HAVE ASKED TO BE\nINCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION.  I BELIEVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE\nDIFFERENT GROUPS IS STIPULATED IN THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE\nALREADY EXPLAINED HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALLOW FOR THE PARTICIPATION\nOF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nCHANGE THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF GOVERNMENT\nOFFICIALS FOR THE MOST PART.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF\nMEMBERS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE\nPAST.\n\n   [MODERATOR] RAUL BELTRAN FROM RADIO CADENA YSKL.\n\n   [BELTRAN] MR. PRESIDENT, OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED\nABOUT THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS\nGARRISONS AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  SINCE YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF\nOF THE ARMED FORCES, DO YOU SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED,\nWHICH CONDEMNED THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COL. SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] CONCERNING THAT SITUATION, I HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL\nPEOPLE HAVE MADE STATEMENTS, NOT JUST ONE.  THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC\nSPECULATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ASSASSINATIONS OF THE\nJESUIT PRIESTS AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.  IF\nSOMEONE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTE, AND IF THAT SOMEONE IS\nREALLY INTERESTED IN THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, HE\nSHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE TO GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION.  HE SHOULD NOT\nCONTINUE TO SPECULATE IN PUBLIC, BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE AND IT\nOBSTRUCTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.\n\n   I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NOT LONG AGO A\nDELEGATION OF SPANISH LEGAL EXPERTS VISITED THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE\nPLEASED TO SEE HOW THE 4TH CRIMINAL JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE JUDICIAL\nPROCESS, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE\nUNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPECULATE IN\nPUBLIC AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED.  IF SOMEONE HAS INFORMATION OR\nEVIDENCE, HE SHOULD GO TO THE JUDGE, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE\nCONFUSION.  IN THAT REGARD, I BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES\nCOMMANDERS' REJECTION OF COL. OCHOA'S STATEMENTS IS JUST THAT.  IN\nMANY OF THE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE -- I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING\nTHE STATEMENT -- THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT AND\nSTRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, BUT THEY CANNOT COME OUT IN PUBLIC\nWITH SPECULATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY CONFUSE PEOPLE.

I THINK THAT, WHETHER\nTHEY HAVE A HIGH OR A LOW MORALE OR WHATEVER, WITH JUST 100 RADICALS\nTHEY COULD KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT.

PRESIDENT, WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT'S MILITARY AID, HAS YOUR GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SEEKING MILITARY AID IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS\nCONTINENT OR FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?  FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT\nA COUNTRY LIKE ISRAEL HAS GIVEN MILITARY AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN\nCOUNTRIES.  HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT, YES, CERTAINLY, THE\nGOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE DUTY OF DEFENDING THE SYSTEM AND\nTHE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY\nHAPPEN, AND WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT OCCUR -- IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL\nALWAYS HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATE RESOURCES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE\nCOUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  A FEW DAYS AGO I LISTENED TO\nSTATEMENTS BY SOME POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER SECTORS, WHO\nCOMPLAINED BECAUSE I SAID: WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING THE\nDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES, AND THERE ARE\nOTHER ALTERNATIVES TO GET RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENSE.  THOSE\nPOLITICIANS SAID IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO AFFECT SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO\nHELP THE NEEDY.  THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS SHOULD THINK\nABOUT WHEN THEY ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN AID.  I BELIEVE THAT IS\nSOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT NEGLECT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST DEFEND\nTHE SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- THROUGH VIOLENCE TO REACH POWER --\nWHICH HAS BEEN TERMED BY CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MANY\nCOUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS ILLEGAL.\n\n   [LOHMAN] HAVE YOU CONSIDERED [WORDS INDISTINCT]\n\n   [CRISTIANI] ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO\nCONSIDERATION SOME ALTERNATIVES.  HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE\nTHE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DEFENSELESS.\n\n   [MODERATOR] WE WILL NOW HAVE QUESTIONS IN ENGLISH.  TOM GIBBS FROM\nTHE BBC.\n\n   [GIBBS] WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF CUTTING U.S.  MILITARY AID?  AND ALSO\nIT SEEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE\nCONTINUATION OF AID THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] JESUITS' CASE, AND ALSO THE\nCLEANING UP OF THE OFFICERS CORPS OF THE ARMY, OR CHANGES IN THE MILITARY.\nHOW INCONVENIENT WOULD IT BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, OR HOW [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nIT WOULD BE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT]?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I THINK THAT, FIRST OF ALL, THE EFFECT OF THE REDUCTION\nOR CUT OF AID WOULD BE TWOFOLD.  ON THE FIRST HAND, I THINK IT WOULD BE A\nNEGATIVE SIGNAL FOR THE FMLN AND FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND AN END\nTO THE CONFLICT THROUGH THE DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN STARTED, AND THAT\nA CUT IN AID MIGHT BE ANALYZED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS OF\nTHE FMLN, AS MEANING A WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEFENSE AND THAT,\nTHEREFORE, THEIR MILITARY VICTORY IS NOW CLOSER.  AND IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT\nMORE DIFFICULT TO END THE CONFLICT IN A SHORT WHILE THROUGH A POLITICAL\nDIALOGUE.  SECONDLY, OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO\nDEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND\nWILL NOT STAND BY WITH A WEAKENED DEFENSE.  THEREFORE, THIS MEANS\nREALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS --\nSOCIAL PROGRAMS, ECONOMIC, OR POLITICAL PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN\nHAVE ACCESS TO, AND OBVIOUSLY TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES.\nTHUS, IT WOULD HAVE A TWOFOLD IMPACT IF THAT WAS THE CASE.\n\n   ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN THE CASE OF\nTHE JESUIT PRIESTS IS ONGOING.  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] TO THINK THAT BEFORE IT HAS ENDED, THAT THERE IS\nPREJUDGEMENT ON WHAT THE RESULTS WOULD BE.  I THINK THAT THE JUDGE, AS\nI SAID EARLIER, HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST THE VISITS OF MANY PEOPLE.  JUST\nRECENTLY A GROUP OF LAWYERS FROM SPAIN CAME IN AND ANALYZED THE CASE,\nAND WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE JUDGE WAS HANDLING THE CASE,\nACCORDING, OBVIOUSLY, TO SALVADORAN LAW.

A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TERMED THE\nMOST RIDICULOUS COMMUNIQUE HE HAD EVER HEARD FROM THE FMLN THE ONE IN\nWHICH THEY JUSTIFIED YESTERDAY'S MILITARY ACTIONS.  HE TERMED THEM\nPROPAGANDA-ORIENTED.  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW DO\nYOU VIEW THIS?\n\n   [UNGO] IN MY OPINION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE HAS ASPECTS THAT ARE\nINTERESTING AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK ARE NOT VALID.  THE TIME AND\nOPPORTUNITY OF THAT ACTION IS AMBIVALENT.  I THINK IT HAS NEGATIVE\nEFFECTS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEM.  THERE IS ALWAYS THE\nFAMOUS VICIOUS CIRCLE WHEREIN IF THE FMLN CEASES TO ACT MILITARILY, IT\nIS BAD FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.  IF IT ACTS\nMILITARILY IT IS ALSO BAD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WANT\nPEACE.  IN THIS SENSE, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS EXHIBITED\nA SHOW OF FORCE, THAT ITS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY\nPROPAGANDA-ORIENTED OR WITH PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES.  IT DOES NOT CEASE\nTO CREATE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE A NEGATIVE REACTION ON\nTHE OTHER'S PART, IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO EASE\nCONFRONTATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SEEK AN AGREEMENT AS MUCH AS\nPOSSIBLE.  I BELIEVE, AS I TOLD PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ON THE TELEPHONE\nYESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE OF OTHER THINGS BUT TOUCHED ON THIS TOPIC,\nTHAT I UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S THESIS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS CRITICIZED THE\nFACT THAT WHEN NEGATIVE THINGS OCCUR, THEY ARE INVOKED TO SUSPEND A\nPROCESS WHICH IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS\nUPHELD THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE.  THE GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED THE\nFMLN WHEN ON TWO OCCASIONS IT SUSPENDED THE DIALOGUE DUE TO TERRORIST\nACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SECURITY CORPS.  THE DIALOGUE\nAND NEGOTIATION PROCESS HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THIS.  I BELIEVE\nTHAT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE ITS OWN MEDICINE.  IT\nSHOULD MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE PROCESS AND NOT USE AS A PRETEXT\nTHE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS TO TRY TO SEEK WAYS OF CONDITIONING OR\nPERTURBING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION, WHICH INVOLVES NOT\nONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, BUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL\nFORCES AS WELL.\n\n   [REPORTER] DR. UNGO, IN THAT SENSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED\nTHROUGH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD BE RESUMED ON 3\nMAY.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S ENVOY ANNOUNCED THAT IT\nWOULD BE THE FIRST PART OF MAY.  DON'T YOU THINK THAT TOO MUCH TIME IS\nBEING SPENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AGREE ON SUMMIT MEETINGS THAT WILL\nPERMIT SECURING AGREEMENTS?\n\n   [UNGO] I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PROCESS IS\nDEVELOPING IN THIS FIRST PHASE, JUDGING BY THE CONDUCT ON THE PART OF\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.

LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A\nPUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A\nDECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE\nSOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND\nTRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE\nEFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE\nSOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR\nSERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.

THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THIS GROUP WILL BE\nDISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING.  THE FOUR-DAY MEETING BEGAN ON 18 MAY AT\nTHE GUAYAS ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.  HOWEVER, THE MEETING WAS CONTINUED\nLATER AT AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL.  DURING THEIR SESSIONS,\nIN ADDITION TO MAKING A DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS, AVC\nLEADERS WILL ALSO ASSESS THE AGREEMENT THEY SIGNED A YEAR AGO WITH THE\nPRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA GOVERNMENT.  THE ACCORD MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR\nTHEM TO CEASE THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE\nWITH SOCIAL SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE\nFOURTH AVC NATIONAL CONFERENCE, AVC LEADER SANTIAGO DILLMAN REPORTED\nON 18 MAY THAT THE FINAL DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS WAS A\nLOGICAL STEP -- AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ARMED\nSTRUGGLE IN ECUADOR AND IN THE REST OF LATIN AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE\nPROPER COURSE.  THEREFORE, HE ANNOUNCED, THIS ALFARIST MEETING WILL\nALSO ANALYZE THE DECISION TO ORGANIZE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY OR TO\nALLOW AVC LEADERS TO JOIN AN ALREADY EXISTING GROUP RECOGNIZED BY THE\nSUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.\n\n   THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE AGENDA OF THE AVC MEETING,\nWHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE ON 21 OR 22 MAY WITH A HISTORICAL\nRESOLUTION.  HOWEVER, AVC LEADERS -- AMONG THEM SANTIAGO DILLMAN,\nMARCO TROYA, PEDRO MONCADA, AND JANETH SOSA -- HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO\nDISCLOSE THE SITE OF THE MEETING, WHICH HAS FRUSTRATED THE WORK OF\nJOURNALISTS.  THE AVC LEADERS PLAN TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF\nDELIVERING WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF AVC MEMBERS TO A SOCIALIST\nINTERNATIONAL DELEGATION IN A CEREMONY SIMILAR TO ONE RECENTLY HELD BY\nTHE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT IN COLOMBIA, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS STAGED\nSEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MILITARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF\nBUSINESSMAN NAIM ISAIAS WITH THE HELP OF THE AVC.\n\n   THE AVC HAS SAID IT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNTRY'S\nINSTITUTIONAL LIFE.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IT WILL PLEDGE TO SURRENDER\nITS WEAPONS -- THE SYMBOL OF ITS REBELLION -- WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE\nWITH OR WITHOUT WEAPONS, AVC LEADERS HAVE SAID.  THE AVC LEADERS\nCONTINUE MEETING AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL AND EXPECT TO\nREACH AN AGREEMENT SOON ON LAYING DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD THEN\nBE DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY.
