THE PURPOSE OF\nTHIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY\nPOST IN LATE AUGUST.\n\n   THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND\nSPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND\nSPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING\nSPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND\nTHAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN\nCOLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS\nUNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES,\nPARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT\nHIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE\nHOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD\nLOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE\nFOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE\nFMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME\nWAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP\nTO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME.\n\n   THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS\nPLAN.  WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS\nPLAN.  THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN\nCOLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT\nARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA,\nAND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY\nIDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE\nVULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.\n\n   THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS,\nAND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY\nASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION.\n\n   THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND\nCORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE\nDISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE FDP HAVE BECOME A\nMAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN\nDISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS.\n\n   BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS\nPROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS\nRUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA\nREMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET\nINTERVENTION.  THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY\nNORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS\nAND THEIR FAMILIES.\n\n   NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM.\nTO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE\nNORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN\nINTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY.\n\n   THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR\n5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW\nWHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S.\nCITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS\nTHAT WERE CAPTURED.\n\n   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR\nMISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE.\nIMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED\nON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED.\n\n   GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE\nTHEM.  WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A\nVIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE\nWENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS\nBECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS\nTHAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE\nWHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN\nPEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR\nSUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE\nCASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL\nAMERICA.\n\n   WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEP\nAHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD\nRESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES.\n\n   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELL\nARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nWORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKE\nKINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKING\nCHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT.\n\n   EDUARDO HERRERA WAS DISMISSED FROM A DIPLOMATIC POST FOR SMUGGLING\n40 BOXES OF WHISKEY PER WEEK INTO ISRAEL.

HE\nSAID THAT THE PEOPLE'S RESOLUTE \"NO\" IN THE REFERENDUM ON 5 OCTOBER\nMUST NOW BE FOLLOWED BY THE OVERTHROW OF PINOCHET AND THE RETURN TO\nDEMOCRACY. THE FORMER SENATOR SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT CONDITION FOR\nTHE PATH INTO THE FUTURE IS THE CREATION OF A BROAD UNITY OF ALL\nOPPOSITION FORCES WHICH CAN WIN A VICTORY OVER PINOCHET.

IN\nADDITION, THE CONSTITUTION--ON THE BASIS OF WHICH PINOCHET INTENDS TO\nCONTINUE IN OFFICE UNTIL MARCH 1990 DESPITE HIS DEFEAT THROUGH THE\nREFERENDUM--MUST BE ABOLISHED TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON THE\nCOUNTRY'S FUTURE IN FREEDOM.\n\n   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM PAID TRIBUTE TO THE GDR'S CONSISTENT POSITION IN\nWORD AND DEED AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THE\nCHILEAN PEOPLE.

WHAT ARE THE ARMED FORCES DOING TO GUARANTEE THE\nPEOPLE'S WELFARE?\n\n   [VIDES] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED TERRORIST\nVIOLENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TERRORIST ACTS\nALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE EXPECTED. THIS DOES NOT\nHAPPEN ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY; WE RECENTLY SAW IT IN SEOUL, BEFORE THE\nOLYMPICS, WHEN GROUPS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE THE AUTHORITIES\nAND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT FROM TAKING PLACE.\n\n   AN OAS MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY IN A FEW\nDAYS. THE EVENT IS BEING THREATENED BY A NUMBER OF ACTS, PARTICULARLY\nTERRORIST ACTS IN THE SAN BENITO, MAX DIAZ, ESCALON, AND SAN FRANCISCO\nNEIGHBORHOODS.  THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WILL PROTEST AGAINST\nTHE OAS MEETING IF THEY CAUSE TERROR IN THOSE AREAS.\n\n   WE ARE EXPECTING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM LATIN AMERICA, CENTRAL\nAMERICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WHOM THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE WILL CALL\nOFF THE MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS THE\nMAIN REASON FOR THE INCREASED VIOLENCE.\n\n   YOU HAVE SEEN THAT WE HAVE INCREASED PATROL OPERATIONS RECENTLY.\nPATROLS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT AROUND THE VOLCANOES NEAR SAN\nSALVADOR. SECURITY MEASURES ARE ALSO BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THE\nPERIPHERY OF SAN SALVADOR AND AROUND THE MEETING VENUE, BUT I CANNOT\nGIVE YOU THE DETAILS. THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE\nOFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING.\n\n   WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM.\nHOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYS\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOT\nNECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA\nOF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFF\nAN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA.\n\n   [REPORTER] GENERAL, THE FMLN'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SO\nOVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAINING\nCONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN IT\nIS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES?\n\n   [VIDES] WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANY\nCIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY\nVISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUP\nMEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT AT\nTHE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVE\nFAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR\nLARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT AND\nUSULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY.\n\n   THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS.  HOWEVER,\nTHE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR\nFIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORIST\nACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERAL\nUPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS.\n\n   THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOP\nTHEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVE\nFAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS.  THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMA\nSHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT.\n\n   THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHT\nNOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASS\nA RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC\nPROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE\nDEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS,\nWHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.

ONE OPTION IS TO KEEP ON DOING\n\"MORE OF THE SAME,\" TO IGNORE THE NEW CONTEXT THAT HAS DEVELOPED\nSINCE 5 OCTOBER, TO DEFUSE THE MONETARY TIME BOMB AND TO APPLY A TIGHT\nTOURNIQUET TO THE ECONOMY TO PREVENT RENEWED OUTBREAKS OF HIGHER\nPRICES.\n\n   THE INFLATION \"BOGEYMAN\" IS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT\n(THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, CPI, IS EXPECTED TO BE UP 1.3 TO 1.5\nPERCENT THIS MONTH), AND EXPLANATIONS ABOUND. GERARDO ACEITUNO, THE\nHEAD OF THE FORECASTING WORKSHOP OF THE LABOR ECONOMY PROGRAM,\nATTRIBUTES THE MOUNTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES TO THE IMPACT OF THE\nWAGE HIKE AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES ON DOMESTIC PRICES.\nHE RECALLS THAT THE PRICES OF FARM PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN \"VIRTUALLY\nFROZEN FOR A YEAR\" AND THAT THIS EXPLAINS THE HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE\nWHOLESALE PRICE INDEX, WHICH FELL ONE PERCENT DURING THE PAST 12\nMONTHS, AND THE CPI, WHICH ROSE 12 PERCENT DURING THE SAME PERIOD.\n\"THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED, EXCEPT IF BUSINESSMEN WANTED\nTO SACRIFICE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS, WHICH HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN\nAFFECTED, BECAUSE THE VAT WAS CUT.\"\n\n   JUAN VILLARZU, IN CONTRAST, PLACES MOST OF THE BLAME FOR THE\nINFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON THE EXCESSIVE QUANTITY OF MONEY. ODDLY\nENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OF\nTHE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE\n\"MINI-ADJUSTMENT.\"  HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED\nBUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIR\nDEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER\n\"ECONOMIC AGENTS\" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT.\nTHE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE \"NOT HAVING TO COMPETE\nWITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN\nCIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEY\nARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST\n4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF.\" IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TO\nITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND \"BURN UP\" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON\nHIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY.  \"I'M THINKING\nABOUT DEVALUATIONS (OF THE PESO) SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THIS\nYEAR.\"\n\n   OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY\n\n   IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THE\nEXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES (WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE) \"CONSTITUTE AN\nEXPLOSIVE SITUATION,\" WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILL\nNOT IGNORE. BECAUSE \"IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, IT\nIS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION.\" AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVEN\nMORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENT\nRISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLS\nFOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A\nHIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT \"IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR\nAN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO\nBE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVY\nCONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH.\"\n\n   ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY\nVISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE\nIT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE\nPOPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS.\nSIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE\nADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT\nIGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.  GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE AN\nINCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE (\"TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIGHER PAY IN\nPRIVATE ENTERPRISE\") AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT (THE RUMOR OF A CUT\nTO 12 PERCENT WAS ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS BEFORE THE PLEBISCITE) AND\nIN THE TAX ON CAPITAL.  BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILL\nSTRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION:\n\"REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAME\nTIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT\nFROM THIS ONE.\" IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER.

THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT\nIN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME IS\nRUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUT\nIT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGS\nARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN.\n\n   CHRISTIAN LEFT [IC] WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THE\nRESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALED\nTHAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEW\nPOLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHO\nWERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD [PARTY FOR DEMOCRACY]: THEY HAVE TO DECIDE\nBETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH.  THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT MAPU [UNITED POPULAR ACTION MOVEMENT]-BARRUETO IS NOT\nADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKE\nPART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO\n[SOCIALIST COMMAND FOR THE NO] OR LEFTIST PARTY.\n\n   THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEY\nCONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY.\n\n   THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY [PS]-ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THE\nMOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO\nSET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT\nTHIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF\nLIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE\nSOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY.\n\n   PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29\nOCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY,\nIN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE\nNUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST\nGROUP.  OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY IN\nTHE \"SOCIALIST SPACE,\" BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT,\nMAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, IN\nOTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TO\nSOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE.\n\n   THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISED\nAT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN \"SACRIFICE\" OF\nPREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS.\n\n   THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A \"CONSENSUS\" VOTE, OF WHOSE\nPUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE WAS TALK OF\n\"THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE\nSOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THE\nPROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TO\nUNLEGALIZED PARTIES.\" THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WAS\nCLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WING\nALLIANCE.
