MANY TIMES YOU HAVE\nHEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A\nWORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO\nHAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR\nOWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF\nLOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE\nGREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,\nUNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,\nAND WELL-BEING.\n\n   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE\nCONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD\nMEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A\nFEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL\nPRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,\nAND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.\nPERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE\nNOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE\nISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO\nMONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE\nPRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,\nESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.\n\n   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN\nGENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE\nSUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A\nGOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS\nAVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO\nIMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET\nUS THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN\nFAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO\nBENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO\nBUY A VEHICLE.\n\n   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS\nEXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,\nWHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS\nCAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE\nLITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE\nHAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.\nMOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT\nPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES\nTO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE\nCURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --\nTHROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN\nNOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO\nPRICE INCREASE.\n\n   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE\nGAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES\nARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE\nSOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR\nNOTHING AT ALL.\n\n   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF\nSOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS\nTHE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE\nLOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT\nCHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE\nMUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT\nFIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN\nEFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.\n\n   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE\nCHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS\nTO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO\nSENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING\nHAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE\nSHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.\n\n   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET\nDISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO\nLONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO\nSUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO\nSEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND\nACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR\nCOUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE\nPHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL\nSALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT\nTHOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.\n\n   THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF\nTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR\nSOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS\nKNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN\nCOME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND\nMAY GOD BLESS YOU.

THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST\nIMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION.\n\n   RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN\nEACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.

ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY\nGERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE\nOF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR\nTWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO\nEXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE\nBRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,\nWHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.\nPALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING\nTHE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.\n\n   THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO\nGROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE\nSECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO\nVIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS\nTHAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO\nBENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION.\nTHE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE\nPALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE\nSUPPLIER.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO\nDO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE\nCORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM\nSMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE\nSTOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS\nMORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS\nINVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY\nOF DRUGS EVERY DAY.\n\n   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF\nTHEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY\nFOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS\nCARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE\nFOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN\nTRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,\nARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS\nOF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES\nTHE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN\nBOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO\nSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO\nFOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE\nTRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),\nNEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES\nOF COCAINE.\n\n   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE\nDRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND\nACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE\nLARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF\nDRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN\nBY LAW.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ\nREGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,\nAND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE\nTRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,\nAND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY\nBUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF\nTRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE\nCOMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED\nIN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.

ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED\nTHAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF\nEVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL\nSALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.\nIN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.\nON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD\nTURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT\nVIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS\nMEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A\nCOMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED\nOF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.\nTHIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE\nMILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT\nTO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT\nTHE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A\nCOUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING\nTO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL\nDESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS\nNEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO\nNEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS\nIS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE\nANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE\nPEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT\nBY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.\n\n   COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG.\nYOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY\nOUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS\nSAID.\n\n   COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS\nYOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR\nCOOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN\nSALVADOR.

THERE WAS A TRIUMPHANT PRESENTATION OF\nAN OFFER TO REDUCE A COUNTRY'S DEBT BY UP TO 20 PERCENT, BUT AS FAR AS\nWE KNOW THAT OFFER HAS NOT MATERIALIZED.  FURTHERMORE, A 20-PERCENT\nREDUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS\nOF POVERTY AND THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA.  THE\nREDUCTION MUST BE MUCH GREATER.  A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILL\nDO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME.  WE BELIEVE -- AND I HAVE\nBEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERY LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT -- THAT ONLY\nTHROUGH OUR ADOPTION OF FIRM AND DIGNIFIED POSITIONS WILL THE\nADVERSARY RELENT.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n\n   [GARCIA] LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THE\nESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION\nHAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NO\nRELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF\nUNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS.\nCOLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTH\nKOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITION\nTELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM.\nNOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARI\nABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODY\nHAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSE\nCOUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZE\nNORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION.\n\n   SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HAS\nSAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE.\nTHIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTH\nKOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVE\nMADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF\nCIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO\nELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.\n\n   THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFF\nTO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.  IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH\nAUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND.  ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE\nPEOPLES OF THE WORLD.  UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE\nFRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR.  THIS MANICHEAN\nCRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER\nVALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED.  HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS\nCOUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN'T?  PERU WILL NOT\nACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS.  WE HAVE HAD\nENOUGH OF THE 1960'S AND 1970'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOT\nTRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA.  PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO\nTRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH.  THIS\nIS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF\nOFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE.\n\n   FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT\nOF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OF\nTHE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.  THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLE\nSPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HAD\nBEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE.  JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOW\nMANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTS\nIN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS.  NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY ARE\nOPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.

THE PROPOSAL COVERS THE SUPPLY OF OIL AND THE SALE OF\nFINISHED PRODUCTS.  ANOTHER POINT INCLUDED IS THE REFINANCING OF THE\nGUATEMALAN DEBT WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH TOTALS $200 MILLION.\n\n   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT'S ACTIVITIES BEGAN TODAY AT MIRAFLORES\nPALACE WHEN, PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE TWO AGREEMENTS, THE\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH HIS GUATEMALAN\nCOUNTERPART.  THE PRESIDENTS THEN HELD A FORMAL WORK SESSION WITH THE\nPARTICIPATION OF TWO COMMISSIONS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL.  GUATEMALA,\nLIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, ARE\nFACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTS\nAS THEY MATURE.  THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONE\nOF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE\nTODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TO\nRESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENT\nINTEREST.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THE\nVENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSE\nAGREEMENT.  FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FIT\nVENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW AND\nTHE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE\nTERMS.  WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THE\nMEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE AND\nUNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. [END RECORDING]\n\n   WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN\nVENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY.  ONE OF THEM IS A\nCOOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT.  ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC AND\nTECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS,\nWHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS.  AS ENERGY AND MINES\nMINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILL\nPERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARMAS] FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OIL\nEXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THAT\nCOULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA.  WITH\nREGARD TO MINING, WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING\nSOME PROGRESS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN GUATEMALA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF\nHELPING GUATEMALA DISCOVER MINERAL DEPOSITS THAT COULD BE VERY\nATTRACTIVE FOR OUR ECONOMIES.

THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO\nMEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND\nKIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME.  THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT\nESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT\nLEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.  MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND\nADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY\nU.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION.  THE\nUNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW\nPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER\nSTATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED [AS\nPUBLISHED] THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC\nAPARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\nUNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS\nHAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO\nPULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS.\n\n   JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\nIMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF\nWARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT\nWAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR\nTRAFFICKING IN DRUGS.  ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES,\nIGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A\nFLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"KENNEDY\" AND\nNUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER \"VIRGINIA,\" TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO\n\"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING.\"  SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE\nSOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE\nDEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED\nFIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS.\nJARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC\nUNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES \"VERY NEARLY\" INVADED COLOMBIA.\nTHE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE\nAUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS\nARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR [AS PUBLISHED] THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA.  IT\nALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS\nTO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE\nGOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO\nJOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. \"DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL\" IN THE CARIBBEAN.

THE\nPUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S.\nAGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF\nINTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF\nWHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980'S.\n\n   IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE\n1980'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE,\nNAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED\nIN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES.  THE\nREAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY.\n\n   IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON\nVICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING,\nAND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL\nAMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTER\nADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH A\nCERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS.  IN 1977 THE\nCARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THE\nPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVER\nTHE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE.  BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUA\nREVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORT\nFOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITH\nTHE SANDINISTA REGIME.

HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE\nTHE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED\nBY COMMUNIST PARTIES.  THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE\nADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.\n\n   DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM,\nTHE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY?  DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM?\nDO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES?\n\n   AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH\nSENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973.  WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE\nOFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A\nPOLITICAL FUNCTION.  MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN\nMISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM'S\nSECRET ALLY.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS\nCAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT.  THAT HAS BEEN DONE\nIN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS.\n\n   DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY.  WILL IT BE\nREPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT?\n\n   AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL.\n\n   DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTER\nGOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITION\nTODAY.\n\n   AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT.  THE VARIOUS\nSOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED.  HOWEVER, THE STRONGEST\nMOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER.\n\n   DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMA\nOF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE?\n\n   AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.  THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES\nIN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL\nDEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST\nFAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER.  THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE.\n\n   DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE\nSTRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAY\nIN THE FUTURE?\n\n   AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR.  AS\nIS THE CASE IN EVERY PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE CANNOT BE A MEMBER OF\nTHE GOVERNMENT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS.
