THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING ORDERED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IS VIEWED BY LOCAL COMMENTATORS\nAS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO VENEZUELA DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO COLOMBIA,\nWITH WHOM VENEZUELA SHARES OVER 2,000 KM.\n\n   THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR\nVENEZUELAN GOVERNMENTS.  ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE\nRAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS,\nSMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND\nCRIMINALS.  THE WAR DECLARED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE\nMEDELLIN CARTEL OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY OF THE DRUG\nCHIEFTAINS, AND PERHAPS SOME DRUG KINGPINS, MAY SEEK REFUGE IN\nVENEZUELAN TERRITORY.\n\n   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WARNED THAT IF DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER THEIR INDUSTRIES TO VENEZUELA THEY\nWILL HAVE TO \"FACE VENEZUELAN JUSTICE, AND CERTAINLY EXTRADITION\nTRIALS.\" THE STATES OF ZULIA, TACHIRA, AND APURE --IN WESTERN\nVENEZUELA -- BORDER COLOMBIAN TERRITORY AND HAVE BEEN THE SCENE OF\nDRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS MANY TIMES.  IN THE PAST FEW DAYS\nVENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES HAVE INCREASED VIGILANCE AT THE MAIN BORDER\nPOSTS BECAUSE OF RUMORS THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEGUN MOVING TO\nVENEZUELA.\n\n   GOVERNOR OF ZULIA STATE ISMAEL ORDAZ CONFIRMED TO NEWSMEN THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED CONTROL AND VIGILANCE MEASURES AT THE\nBORDER WITH COLOMBIA.  HE NOTED THERE IS BROAD COOPERATION BETWEEN THE\nVENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.\n\n   DURING A RADIO PROGRAM ON MONDAY, 4 SEPTEMBER, JOURNALIST JOSE\nVICENTE RANGEL, FORMER MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, MAINTAINED THAT IT IS NOT AT THIS TIME THAT DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ENTERED A\nLONG TIME AGO.  RANGEL MAINTAINED THAT VENEZUELA ANNUALLY SERVES AS A\nBRIDGE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING WORTH SOME $20 BILLION.  FURTHERMORE, HE\nSAID, THE EXPENSIVE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED\nRESOURCES OBTAINED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   THE FIGURES GIVEN BY RANGEL ARE EQUIVALENT TO 66 PERCENT OF THE\nVENEZUELAN FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME $30 MILLION THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE.  MOREOVER, RANGEL SAID,\nDURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT CONCLUDED WITH THE ELECTION OF\nCARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IN DECEMBER 1988, POLITICAL PARTIES INVESTED SOME\n5 BILLION BOLIVARES (SOME $135 MILLION) IN PROPAGANDA.  THIS FIGURE IS\nEXCESSIVE IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW,\nTHE STATE ONLY CONTRIBUTES 100 MILLION BOLIVARES ($2.7 MILLION) FOR\nTHE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HELD EVERY 5 YEARS.\n\n   RANGEL ADDED THAT THE POSSIBLE TRANSFER OF COLOMBIAN DRUG\nTRAFFICKING OPERATION CENTERS TO VENEZUELA IS VERY WORRYING IF ONE\nTAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE OPENLY\nADMITTED THE LACK OF VIGILANCE AT THE BORDERS.  HOWEVER, WHILE\nCOLOMBIA IS ATTEMPTING, PERHAPS BELATEDLY, NOT TO YIELD TO THE\nECONOMIC POWER AND VIOLENCE OF DRUGS, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO AWARENESS\nIN VENEZUELA ABOUT THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY THE ALLEGED CHANGE OF\nADDRESS WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, IS BEING PLANNED BY\nCOLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0430 (LSI)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [GARCIA] [TEXT]\n[CONTINUED] IT IS CLEAR THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE\nNORTH.  IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS\nAND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE\nIDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS.  IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN\nIDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE\nSTATES OF THE SOUTH.  UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND\nPROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO\nELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET.\n\n   WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME.  IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD\nTHEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES.\n\n   WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES\nTHAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS.  I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR\nSTATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION.  WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE\nUNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS.  WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY.\n\n   ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT\nPROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET.  IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO\nCALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR\nMOVEMENT.  WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL\nBASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES.\n\n   MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE\nSTRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY.  THIS CAN BE\nVIEWED AS A SUGGESTION.  IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO\nRECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE\nINTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.\nTHESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF\nTHE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER.\n\n   ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY\nADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE\nPOLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES\nCOMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER\n-- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT.  WITHOUT\nTHE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES\nOF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY\nSERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS\nSPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.\n\n   IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF\nCONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION.  YET IT IS ALSO TRUE\nTHAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS.  LIKE\nNEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER.\n\n   DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH\nMARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY.\nDRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN\nCOLOMBIA.\n\n   I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE\nSHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE,\nWE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE\nDEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION.\n\n   THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT\nTOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL.\n\n   THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION.  IT\nINVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE,\nAND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER.\n\n   THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL\nTREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT.\n\n   OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND\nUNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT.  THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT\nMUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT\nIS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU.\n\n   FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD\nSTRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH.  THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR\nNATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST\nDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR\nFAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST\nCOLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE\nNATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.  WE CAME TO DEFEND\nIDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT.  WE CAME TO DEMAND FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT AND\nTHE RECOGNITION OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE DEBT.  WE ARE HERE TO\nREITERATE OUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE UNITED\nBEHIND 28 YEARS AGO.\n\n   I SALUTE THE NATIONS OF THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT.  THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH.

IN BOGOTA, MEDELLIN, CALI, AND OTHER TOWNS SHOTS ARE HEARD,\nBOMBS EXPLODE, BLOOD IS FLOWING, AND MORE AND MORE OFTEN WE HEAR THE\nWORDS THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  THIS IS THE HEART OF THE COLOMBIAN MAFIA.\nWHAT IS IT?  HOW DID IT FORM?  WITH THIS QUESTION I TURN TO YOU, YURIY\nNIKOLAYEVICH.  INCIDENTALLY, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN IN MEDELLIN.\n\n   [ISAYEV] YES, WHILE WORKING IN LATIN AMERICA AS A CORRESPONDENT FOR\nUSSR STATE TELEVISION AND RADIO I WAS ABLE TO VISIT MEDELLIN ONCE.\nTHERE WAS A SEMINAR THERE ON THE PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.\nOUTWARDLY IT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE TOWN, VERY GREEN, SITUATED ON A\nPLAIN, AND IT IS CALLED ETERNALLY BLOSSOMING.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IN\nMEDELLIN BURSTS OF SUBMACHINEGUN FIRE RANG OUT SUDDENLY IN THE STREETS\nAND I UNDERSTOOD THEN THAT I WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE COCAINE MAFIA.\nTWO CLANS OF BANDITS WERE EXCHANGING FIRE AND PASSERS-BY LITERALLY HAD\nTO RUN AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY COULD.\n\n   LOCAL COLLEAGUES SHOWED ME A HUGE DISTRICT CONSISTING OF LUXURIOUS\nVILLAS WHERE THE GODFATHERS OF THE COLOMBIA DRUG MAFIA LIVE.  IT IS\nDIFFICULT TO EVEN APPROACH THESE HOUSES: THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY BARBED\nWIRE AND THERE ARE VIDEO CAMERAS AND WATCH TOWERS.  IF YOU DECIDE TO\nGO FAIRLY CLOSE THE GUARDS WILL OPEN FIRE WITHOUR WARNING.  I WAS ALSO\nABLE TO SEE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY CASTLE, A RARE AND EXTREMELY\nBEAUTIFUL BUILDING, A GENUINE ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENT.  THIS CASTLE\nBELONGS TO ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MAFIA, CARLOS LEHDER.\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] YES, YURIY NIKOLAEVICH, BUT HOW WAS THE MEDELLIN\nCARTEL FORMED?  SOME INFORMATION ON ITS HISTORY, IF YOU COULD.\n\n   [ISAYEV] BY RIGHTS THE FOUNDER OF THE CARTEL IS CONSIDERED TO BE\nCARLOS ENRIQUE LEHDER, WHO WAS ABLE TO UNITE THE COCAINE MAFIA OF\nCOLOMBIA AROUND HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTIES.  A FEW WORDS\nABOUT LEHDER HIMSELF: HE IS A DESPERATE EXTREMIST WHO HOLDS NOTHING\nSACRED.  HE HAS HUNDREDS OF HUMAN LIVES ON HIS CONSCIENCE.  IT IS NOT\nFOR NOTHING THAT HIS FRIENDS GAVE HIM AT VARIOUS TIMES THE NICK NAMES\nRUM ROBIN HOOD, THE DRUGS BARON, AND SO ON.  CARLOS LEHDER IS\nDISTINGUISHED FOR HIS AUDACITY AND A RESTLESS DISPOSITION.  TOGETHER\nWITH HIM OTHER COLOMBIAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN THIS\nADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS, NAMELY THE OCHOA AND ESCOBAR FAMILIES.  AT THE\nEND OF THE EIGHTIES [AS HEARD] A COCAINE WAR BEGAN BETWEEN THESE THREE\nCLANS.  LATER, HOWEVER, THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND THE MEDELLIN\nCARTEL WAS FORMED\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] IN THE PRESS MANY REPORTS HAVE APPEARED STATING THAT\nLITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE CARTEL.\nIS THIS TRUE?\n\n   [ISAYEV] THE CARTEL'S ANNUAL INCOME, AS THE PRESS CLAIMS, IS $8\nBILLION.  TO SKETCH THE SCALE OF COCAINE OPERATIONS I WILL REMIND YOU\nTHAT IN 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARTEL BIGWIGS PROPOSED TO THE\nGOVERNMENT TO CLEAR COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE FOREIGN DEBT WITHIN A WEEK --\nAND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS $9 BILLION -- IF THE GOVERNMENT\nWOULD RELEASE MAFIA MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED.  NOT VERY LONG AGO\nA WEST GERMAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE\nWORLD AND ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- JORGE OCHOA -- IS\nBY NO MEANS LAST ON THAT LIST.  I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ANOTHER CASE\nTHAT CHARACTERIZES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DRUG MAFIA'S MEANS. FOUR\nYEARS AGO IT CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE CARTEL HAD TAKEN PART IN\nNEGOTIATIONS ON BUYING A WHOLE CONSIGNMENT OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES,\nSEVERAL MILITARY HELICOPTERS, AND OTHER MODERN WEAPONS.\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] HOW IS THIS LETHAL ARSENAL USED?\n\n   [ISAYEV] IT IS COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT THE CARTEL COULD NOT EXIST\nWITHOUT A COMPLETE ARMY OF MERCENARY KILLERS AND INFORMANTS WHO HAVE\nPENETRATED INTO LITERALLY ALL SPHERES OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY,\nPARLIAMENT, AND THE ARMY.  THE MAIN TARGET OF THE MAFIOSI ARE\nPROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS, WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THREATEN THE DRUGS\nBUSINESS.  I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE SAME CARLOS LEHDER IN 1984\nORGANIZED THE ASSASSINATION OF LARA BONILLA, THE COLOMBIAN MINISTER OF\nJUSTICE.  IN 1986 GUILLERMO CANO, THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE\nNEWSPAPER EL ESPECTADOR WAS MURDERED, AND IT WAS BASICALLY AFTER THIS\nMUDER THAT THE HUNT FOR LEHDER BEGAN.  IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS\nARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO U.S. JUSTICE, WHICH SENTENCED HIM TO LIFE\nIMPRISONMENT.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGREEMENT\nBETWEEN THE U.S. AND COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENTS ON THE EXTRADITION OF\nESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.\n\n   [VEDENYAPIN] IF WE TAKE THE PRESENT WAR -- IT CANNOT BE CALLED\nANYTHING ELSE -- WHAT WERE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSES?

TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE CALLED, \"AMERICA'S TOUGHEST\nDOMESTIC TEST IN DECADES\" DURING HIS STERN ADDRESS ON TUESDAY, THE US\nLEADER HAS GIVEN A NEW BOOST TO THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE\nAGAINST NARCOTICS.\n\n   THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY,\nMOST OF ALL BY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY COLOMBIA WHICH IS\nFIGHTING A DESPERATE BATTLE AGAINST COCAINE BARONS.

IN THE COUNTRY'S LONG WAR AGAINST DRUG\nDEALERS, NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW -- THE MERCILESS KILLING\nOF SECURITY OFFICERS AND THEIR RELATIVES -- HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.\nSHOULD COLOMBIA LOSE THIS WAR AGAINST COCAINE BARONS, DRUG LORDS IN\nOTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL FLEX THEIR MUSCLES TOO.  TO PUT IT\nPLAINLY, COLOMBIA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS WAR.

WHILE SHE HAS ACCEPTED\nSOME LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUCH AS HELICOPTERS, FROM WASHINGTON, SHE\nMAINTAINS HERE OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF US TROOPS IN TACKLING WHAT SHE\nRIGHTLY REGARDS AS A DOMESTIC CRISIS.  THE STATEMENT BY MR BUSH ON\nWEDNESDAY HAS SO FAR MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS OPPOSITION.  THE\nPROBLEM FACING BOGOTA IS, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE LOGISTIC SUPPORT\nFROM US WOULD HELP, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT OVERNIGHT RAISE THE STRENGTH\nOF ITS ANI-NARCOTIC SECURITY FORCES.  WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nOFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES, BOGOTA CAN, OF COURSE, BUY ARMS FOR USE\nAGAINST DRUG BARONS.

TRUE, IT\nIS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO WIN ITS\nINTERNAL WAR, WITH ALL THE HELP THAT WASHINGTON CAN PROVIDE.  BUT THE\nREAL BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS MUST BE FOUGHT WITHIN THE UNITED\nSTATES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO AND ALL OTHER\nCITIES.  THIS IS THE MARKET FOR THE COCAINE BARONS OF COLOMBIA OR FOR\nTHE DRUGS PRODUCED IN THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN TRIANGLE IN ASIA.  AND IT IS\nALSO WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHERE ALL THE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION,\nSOME CONTROLLED BY US CITIZENS, THRIVE UNDER THE EYES OF THE US LAW\nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY ASK IF ENOUGH\nHAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE US END.\n\n   THIS STATEMENT BY MR BUSH SUGGESTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS\nRECOGNISED THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  A\nMAJOR PORTION OF THE FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE ANTI-DRUG WAR WILL BE\nUSED IN STRENGTHENING THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED\nSTATES.

I\nEXPRESSED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD VOTE AGAINST\nPINOCHET, DESPITE PINOCHET'S RESOURCES AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE\nAND TERRORIST METHODS THAT WERE USED TO INTIMIDATE THE MASSES.

HOWEVER, IT IS A FACT THAT NOBODY CAN\nASSERT HERE THAT PINOCHET'S DEFEAT IN THE ELECTION WILL BE THE\nSOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DICTATORSHIP IN CHILE.  I AM NOT\nTALKING ABOUT A REVOLUTION.

WE COULD ALMOST SAY THAT HE WILL STAY ON AS A SORT OF\nSENTINEL, A POWER ON WHICH THE COUNTRY'S DESTINY WOULD CONTINUE TO\nHANG FOR SOME TIME TO COME.  WHETHER HE CAN REALLY FULFILL THE GOALS\nHE HAS SET FOR HIMSELF REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN HE\nWILL NOT GIVE UP POWER WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.  ONLY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE\nCAN MAKE THIS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE AND FULL\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING, AN OPENING WITHOUT ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE\nREGIME HAS WRITTEN INTO ITS CONSTITUTION, WHICH GRANTS HIM ALL OF\nTHESE RIGHTS -- TO BE A SENATOR FOR LIFE, AND, IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT\nFAIL ME, TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY FOR AN ADDITIONAL 8 YEARS.\nLOOK AT HIS HARANGUES.  HIS HARANGUES ARE STILL AGGRESSIVE, HAUGHTY,\nAND THREATENING.  WE HEAR WARNINGS.  WE HEAR APPEALS TO THE ARMY TO\nREMAIN UNITED, BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF.\n\n   I THINK HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CORNERED BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE,\nBECAUSE A NEW STAGE WILL BEGIN AFTER THE ELECTIONS.
