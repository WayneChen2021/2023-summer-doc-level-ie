[{"text": "   CLANDESTINE, 12 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE\nRECEIVED A LAST MINUTE REPORT FROM SAN MIGUEL.  WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED\nTHAT, PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION, DURING CLASHES WITH THE ENEMY IN LA\nESMERALDA NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN MIGUEL, OUR REBEL ARMY CONFISCATED THREE\n22-MM RIFLES, TWO .38-CAL PISTOLS, ONE 22-MM PISTOL, AND ONE CZECH\nPISTOL.  ON 6TH EAST STREET OF THE CITY, AN ENEMY OFFICER AND A\nSERGEANT WERE KILLED AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED.  WE REPEAT, TWO\nSOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED AT 6TH EAST STREET IN SAN MIGUEL.  ONE OF THE\nSOLDIERS SURRENDERED TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE WAS WOUNDED.  THERE IS A\nMARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND OUR GUERRILLA ARMY.  WHEN\nFASCIST TROOPS CAPTURE WOUNDED REBELS IN SAN SALVADOR, THEY QUESTION\nTHEM FIRST AT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS\nAND THEN MURDER THEM.  OUR ARMY RESPECTS THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS.\n\n   WE CONTINUE OUR SAN MIGUEL REPORTING.  AT 1030 TODAY, WE DESTROYED\nA LIGHT TANK ON 6TH NORTH AVENUE THEREBY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF\nLIGHT TANKS THAT WE HAVE DESTROYED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  OTHER\nREPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATE THAT THE\nTOTAL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IN ZACATECOLUCA AS OF 1618, IS 45,\nINCLUDING TWO SECTION CHIEFS.  HEAVY FIGHTING CONTINUES IN\nZACATECOLUCA NEIBORHOODS.  IN SOYAPANGO, WHERE WE HAD RECEIVED A\nREPORT OF 50 CASUALTIES, WE HAVE NOW BEEN INFORMED THAT THE NUMBER OF\nCASUALTIES INFLICTED ON THE ENEMY HAS INCREASED TO 70.  WE HAVE\nINFLICTED 70 CASUALTIES ON AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL\nBUSTILLO'S CRIMINAL AIR FORCE.  THIS NUMBER INCLUDES AN OFFICER.  WE\nHAVE INFLICTED 10 CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE FORCES. WE HAVE\nRECEIVED REPORTS THAT 3 HELICOPTERS WERE DAMAGED IN SOYAPANGO WHERE\nCLASHES HAVE ENSUED AND CONTINUE AT 1619.  REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR\nAND SAN MIGUEL INDICATE THAT AT THIS TIME CLASHES ARE INCREASING IN\nINTENSITY IN BOTH PLACES.  A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE RECEIVED A REPORT\nFROM SAN MIGUEL THAT OUR COMRADES WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND FORCING THE\n3D INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS TO WITHDRAW.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0701 (UNL/USL, NCCOSC)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 12 NOV (ACAN -

ON 19\nMARCH, OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO\nDEMANDED POLITICAL STABILITY, PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, AS WELL AS\nJUDICIAL AND SOCIAL SECURITY IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE IRRATIONAL ACTIONS\nTHAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS\nUNLEASHED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND PARTICULARLY AS OF YESTERDAY, MAKE\nIT NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION, TO\nTAKE FIRM ACTION WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   WE MUST ACCEPT THE PEOPLE'S MANDATE OF 19 MARCH, AND THE GOVERNMENT\nMUST NOW RESPOND WITH FIRM ACTION, WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  WE\nMUST RESPOND BECAUSE THE FMLN IS ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION --\nMORE THAN ANYONE ELSE -- IN A BRUTAL AND SAVAGE MANNER.  THE ARMED\nFORCES OF EL SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AND THEY HAVE\nCONTROLLED THE SITUATION.\n\n   HOWEVER, THESE FMLN TERRORISTS, WHO ALREADY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN\nDEFEATED BY THE ARMED FORCES, ARE NOW BEGINNING TO CARRY OUT\nINDISCRIMINATE ACTS OF TERRORISM.  THEY ARE EVEN GOING AS FAR AS\nENTERING INNOCENT HOMES TO PRESSURE FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE\nTHROUGH THESE HARSH TIMES THAT ALL SALVADORANS HAVE EXPERIENCED.\n\n   THAT IS WHY WE MUST ACT FIRMLY BUT WITHIN THE LAW.  TO THIS EFFECT,\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MET AT 1400 IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL HOUSE TO TRY TO SOLVE SOMETHING WE ARE COMPLETELY SURE IS\nWHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANT.  WHEN WE SAT DOWN TO TALK WITH THE\nMEMBERS OF THE CABINET, WE RECALLED ARTICLE 2 OF OUR CONSTITUTION,\nWHICH SAYS: ALL PERSONS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE, PHYSICAL AND MORAL\nINTEGRITY, FREEDOM, SECURITY, WORK, PROPERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO BE\nPROTECTED AND HAVE THEIR LIVES AND POSSESSIONS DEFENDED.\n\n   THAT IS WHY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THIS AFTERNOON MADE A\nDECISION, BASED ON THE LEGAL MECHANISMS GRANTED TO IT BY THE\nCONSTITUTION.  FIRST, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, I WILL READ ARTICLE 29 OF THE\nCONSTITUTION, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n   ARTICLE 29.  IN CASES OF WAR, INVASION OF THE TERRITORY, REBELLION,\nSEDITION, CATASTROPHE, EPIDEMIC, OR OTHER GENERAL CALAMITY, OR IN\nCASES OF GRAVE DISRUPTION OF THE PUBLIC ORDER, THE GUARANTEES\nESTALISHED IN ARTICLES 5, ARTICLE 6, SUBPARAGRAPH 1, ARTICLE 7,\nSUBPARAGRAPH 1, AND ARTICLE 24 CAN BE SUSPENDED, EXCEPT WHEN REFERRING\nTO MEETINGS OR GROUPS FOR RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND SPORTS\nPURPOSES.  THE SUSPENSION CAN AFFECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OR PART OF IT\nAND WILL BE DONE THROUGH A DECREE ISSUED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR\nTHE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE GUARANTEES CONTAINED IN\nARTICLE 12, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, AND IN ARTICLE 13, SUBPARAGRAPH 2, OF THE\nCONSTITUTION CAN BE SUSPENDED, WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SO DECIDES\nBY A THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTED DEPUTIES, BUT THE\nADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION DETENCION ADMINISTRATIVA SHOULD NOT BE\nLONGER THAN 15 DAYS.\n\n   THE SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WILL NOT EXCEED 30\nDAYS.  ONCE THIS PERIOD EXPIRES, THE SUSPENSION CAN BE EXTENDED FOR A\nSIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME, THROUGH A NEW DECREE, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES\nTHAT LED TO IT CONTINUE.  IF THAT DECREE IS NOT ISSUED, THE SUSPENDED\nGUARANTEES WILL BE FULLY RESTORED.\n\n   AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE\nBRANCH OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS APPROPRIATE...  [CHANGES THOUGHT] FOR\nTHAT PURPOSE WE ACT BASED ON ARTICLE 167, NO.  6, WHICH READS: IT IS\nUP TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TO SUSPEND AND RESTORE THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 29 OF THIS CONSTITUTION\nIF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS NOT IN SESSION.

NOW IS THE TIME\nFOR ALL THOSE WHO INTEND TO WORK WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO STATE\n-- IN A CATEGORICAL MANNER -- THAT THEY ABIDE BY AND SUPPORT THE\nREPUBLIC'S INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO\nWORK AND PEACEFULLY WAGE A STRUGGLE TO ATTAIN POWER.

HE SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN\nTRYING TO CONFUSE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY SAYING THAT IN EL\nSALVADOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.\nHOWEVER, EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT THE FMLN HAS BEEN PLANTING BOMBS,\nAND SO FAR 8 CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE THAN 100 HAVE BEEN\nWOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THAT INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM.\n\n   IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN ORTEGA AND MAKE HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR\nSENDING THE WEAPONS USED TO KILL AND TO BLEED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO\nDEATH.  HE SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THESE ACTIONS WHILE\nTRYING TO HIDE THEM AND TO DECEIVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.\n\n   IT IS ALSO TIME TO OPENLY CONDEMN THE FMLN FOR ITS IRRATIONAL\nACTIONS.  EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT SINCE THE 1ST DAY OF THIS\nADMINISTRATION, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OFFERED TO BEGIN A\nDIALOGUE PROCESS.  IT OFFERED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THROUGH RATIONAL\nAND PEACEFUL MEANS, SINCE THAT IS WHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WANTED\nAND THAT IS WHAT THEY DEMANDED ON 19 MARCH ELECTION DAY.\n\n   WE CAN NO LONGER ALLOW THE FMLN LEADERS TO TRAVEL FREELY THROUGHOUT\nTHE WORLD IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISINFORM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,\nWHICH INSTEAD OF FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF DISINFORMATION SHOULD\nCATEGORICALLY CONDEMN THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].\n\n   WE ARE NOT ISSUING THIS CALL TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON BEHALF OF\nTHE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  WE ARE MAKING THIS CALL ON BEHALF OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAVAGERY OF INDISCRIMINATE\nTERRORISM.  WE ISSUE THIS CALL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AND WE ARE CONVINCED\nTHAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE THIS FATE.  THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ATTACKED WITH TERRORIST BOMBS. THEY SHOULD\nNOT BE FACING THE THREATS THE FMLN IS TRYING TO CARRY OUT.  THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD DURING THESE LONG 10 YEARS THAT\nTHEY WANT PEACE, DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS, AND DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNDER\nSYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY OBSOLETE IN HISTORY, THAT ARE NO LONGER\nJUSTIFIED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME WHEN THE WORLD IS EVOLVING TOWARD\nPEACE AND DEMOCRACY.\n\n   ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE, WE ARE ASKING YOU TO CONDEMN THE FMLN'S\nIRRATIONAL ATTITUDE.\n\n   WE ALSO WANT TO TELL THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE SUPPORTING\nTHEIR PEOPLE AND WILL NEVER PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO LEAD TO\nANYTHING ELSE BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT MOVEMENT THAT HAS TAINTED\nOUR HISTORY.  WE WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THE WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN\nEL SALVADOR IS THROUGH REASONING AND PEACEFUL MEANS AND THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO ACHIEVE PEACE AS\nSOON AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK: THROUGH REASONING AND\nPEACEFUL MEANS.\n\n   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AGAIN WE URGE YOU TO REMAIN CALM.

WE USE STRICTLY MILITARY TECHNIQUES\nAND TACTICS.\n\n   WE ASK THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM GOING OUT IN THE NEXT 8 HOURS, OR AT LEAST\nSTAY OFF THE STREETS.  IF YOU MUST GO OUT, DO IT, BUT WALK IN THE MIDDLE\nOF THE STREET.  DO NOT RUN, AND DO NOT FEAR THE AUTHORITIES.  THE\nAUTHORITIES ARE THERE TO PROTECT YOUR SAFETY WHICH IS BEING AFFECTED.  THE\nAUTHORITIES WISH TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR TRANQUILITY.  I WANT YOU TO REST\nASSURED THAT WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU.  BEFORE A MARXIST-LENINIST PLAN TAKES\nOVER ONE OF OUR CITIES OR TOWNS, THEY WILL HAVE TO WALK OVER THE BODIES OF\nEACH AND EVERY SOLDIER. THE SOLDIERS ARE WILLING TO DEFEND EACH AND EVERY\nONE OF YOU.\n\n   THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.  I JUST WANTED TO SEND YOU THIS\nMESSAGE OF FAITH, HOPE, AND TRUST IN YOUR GOVERNMENT AND YOUR\nINSTITUTION.  THAT IS ESSENTIAL.  WE MUST NOT YIELD WHEN CONFRONTED BY\nMARXIST OR COMMUNIST PLANS.  OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR ARMED FORCES NEED YOUR\nSUPPORT TODAY MORE THAN EVER.  SUPPORT OUR STRUGGLE IN DEFENSE OF THE\nDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  REST ASSURED THAT ALONG THIS PATH THERE IS NO RETURN.\nWE EITHER ACHIEVE OUR FINAL GOAL OF CONSOLIDATION, OR WE FALL ALONG THE\nPATH.  WE MUST GIVE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC\nHOMELAND.

THE ARMED FORCES WANT TO\nPUBLICLY RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR COOPERATION DURING\nTHIS TIME WHEN THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]\nTERRORIST HORDES ARE CARRYING OUT AN ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST ALL OF\nOUR PEOPLE.\n\n   THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:  FIGHTING\nIS ONGOING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF SAN SALVADOR -- IN MEJICANOS,\nCUSCATANCINGO, AND THE ZACAMIL AREAS.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME CLASHES IN THE\nNORTHWESTERN AREA OF SOYAPANGO, IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF BOSQUES DEL\nRIO, MONTE FRESCO, EL PETETE, AND SAN JOSE.\n\n   THERE IS SOME SPORADIC FIGHTING IN CIUDAD CREDISA, AS WELL AS IN SANTA\nMARTA.  THAT IS WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN\nTHE AREA OF SAN SALVADOR.  \n\n   IN THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS, ON SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS FIGHTING\nIN SAN MIGUEL, SANTA ANA, ZACATECOLUCA, USULUTAN, AND SOME SPORADIC\nFIGHTING IN CHALATENANGO.  OF ALL THESE PLACES, THE TERRORISTS INCREASED\nTHEIR AGGRESSION TODAY ONLY IN ZACATECOLUCA.  THE TERRORISTS,\nUNFORTUNATELY, TOOK OVER THE HOSPITAL IN ZACATECOLUCA, KILLING ONE SOLDIER\nWHO WAS RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT.  THE ARMED FORCES HAVE REGAINED\nCONTROL OF THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOORS OF THE HOSPITAL.  APPROXIMATELY 10\nTO 15 TERRORISTS ARE ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS, AND THE TROUBLE IS\nTHAT THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE ON THOSE FLOORS.\n\n   SO, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED AGGRESSION, THE INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM\nTHAT THE FMLN HAS LAUNCHED AT THIS TIME IN AN IRRATIONAL MANNER AGAINST\nTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, HAS BEEN CONTROLLED.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE FIGHTING\nIN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AGAINST THESE TERRORISTS.  \n\n   [REPORTER] TO SUM UP, WE COULD THEN SAY THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW\nGUERRILLA RESISTANCE POCKETS IN THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED.  THIS\nCONTRADICTS THE REPORTS FROM THE CLANDESTINE RADIO STATIONS TO THE EFFECT\nTHAT THEY CONTROL CERTAIN AREAS.\n\n   [PONCE] I MUST ALSO ADD THAT THERE IS ALSO SOME FIGHTING IN CIUDAD\nDELGADO.  I CAN CATEGORICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT CONTROL ANY\nPOINT IN OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY.  THEY ARE SHOUTING ABROAD THAT THEY\nCONTROL CERTAIN POINTS IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, THE\nMEDIA, AND THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ARE WITNESSES TO THE FACT THE FMLN\nDOES NOT CONTROL ANY PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR OR IN THE OTHER\nDEPARTMENTS.  THERE ARE STILL SOME FMLN REDOUBTS, WHICH WE ARE\nCURRENTLY CONTROLLING IN ORDER TO EXPEL FROM THE URBAN AREAS THE\nTERRORISTS WHO ARE ATTACKING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.\n\n   NATURALLY, WE HAVE SOME COMBAT LIMITATIONS IN THE URBAN AREAS, BECAUSE\nTHE TERRORISTS ARE SHIELDING THEMSELVES BEHIND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND\nARE HOLDING MANY FAMILIES HOSTAGES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. THE TERRORISTS HAVE\nALSO PLACED SNIPERS ON SOME TALL BUILDINGS. THAT IS WHY THE ARMED FORCES\nARE ASKING FOR THE PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING.  IF WE WERE TO USE OUR MILITARY\nPOWER, AS WE COULD DO IN A COMBAT ZONE, WE WOULD KILL MANY INNOCENT\nPEOPLE.

OTHERWISE, OR IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A TELEPHONE, IT IS IMPORTANT\nTHAT THEY LEAVE THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR ARMS UP CARRYING SOME WHITE FLAG OR\nCLOTH AND GO TO A NEARBY UNIT TO GET AID.

THEY THINK\nTHAT...\n\n   [SUAREZ, INTERRUPTING] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHICH IS TERRIBLE.\n\n   [CASTRO] I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS THAT THE SALVADORANS ARE PRESENTLY\nCARRYING OUT ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS THAT HAVE EVER\nBEEN WRITTEN.  DESPITE THE 10 YEARS [OF STRUGGLE], THE\nBILLIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY AND SUPPLYING IT WITH THE MOST MODERN TYPES OF ARMS,\nNOTICE HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIGHT.  NOTICE WHAT IS BEING DONE.  HOW\nARE THEY USING THE YANKEE BOMBS AND PLANES?  THEY ARE BEING USED TO\nMASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  JUST NOTICE HOW THEY ARE\nINDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING THE PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE IN THE\nHANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARIES.  WHAT THE IMPERIALISTS ARE DOING IS\nSOMETHING REPUGNANT.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT WHAT THE SALVADORANS ARE\nDOING IS AMAZING, ADMIRABLE.  WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHOWING THE\nIMPERIALISTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FAR FROM KNEELING BEFORE THEM.  THEIR\nACTIONS ARE SHOWING IMPERIALISM THAT THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING\nWITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE EUPHORIA THAT CURRENTLY OVERCOMES THEM UNDER\nTHESE CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n   [SUAREZ] COMMANDER, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF WHY WE\nHAVE SO MANY FRIENDS?  WE, THE CUBANS ARE WHAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE A\nMIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN.\n\n   [CASTRO] I THINK WE HAVE THE FRIENDS WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED\nA POLICY OF PRINCIPLE.  I THINK THE FRIENDS WE HAVE ARE BASICALLY DUE\nTO THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RESPECT THE REVOLUTION MERITS,\nTHE ETHICS OF THE REVOLUTION, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION.\nNOW, THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO A MIXTURE OF CARIBBEANS, THAT IS\nSOMETHING ELSE.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.  [WORD\nINDISTINCT] REASONS WE CAN HAVE CONGENIALITY.  HOWEVER, CONGENIALITY\nDOES NOT ALWAYS TURN INTO TRUE FRIENDSHIP.  THERE COULD BE\nCONGENIALITY BUT IT DOES NOT RESULT IN FRIENDSHIP.  FRIENDSHIP IS MORE\nA RESULT OF RECOGNITION, ADMIRATION FOR A COUNTRY.\n\n   [SUREZ] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT...\n\n   [CASTRO] THIS SMALL COUNTRY WAS FACING THE EMPIRE, IT BECAME A\nBASTION OF DIGNITY FOR THE WORLD.  I THINK THIS MERITS CERTAIN\nRECOGNITION AND LIKING. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND OF THE FRIENDS WE\nHAVE.  I APPRECIATE THESE FRIENDS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE\nYANKEE PRESSURES.  THEY ARE FRIENDS OF CUBA DESPITE YANKEE THREATS,\nINTRIGUES, AND CAMPAIGNS.  THIS SAYS A LOT.  THE YANKEES WANTED TO\nBURY AND DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE MEDIA AGENCIES THEY OWN.\nHOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT.  THAT IS WHY UNDER\nTHESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY\nTHAT OTHER NATIONS RENDER US.  ASIDE, FROM THAT, WE ARE CARIBBEANS.\nWE ARE A GOOD MIXTURE.  WE ARE A MIXTURE OF WHICH WE ARE PROUD.  WE\nARE A MIXTURE OF INDIAN, AFRICAN, AND EUROPEAN.

THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IGNACIO ELLACURIA, SEGUNDO\nMONTES, IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, JOAQUIN LOPEZ, AMANDO LOPEZ, AND JUAN\nRAMON MORENO, ALONG WITH MRS JULIA ELBA RAMOS AND HER DAUGHTER CELINA\nRAMOS, WAS PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES DEATH SQUADS AT DAWN TODAY.\n\n   A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 MEN DRESSED IN GREEN STORMED INTO THE PRIESTS'\nRESIDENCE AND RIDDLED THEM WITH BULLETS FIRED FROM HEAVY CALIBER\nWEAPONS.  THREE OF THE BODIES WERE DRAGGED OUT TO THE PATIO WHERE THEY\nWERE GIVEN DEATH BLOWS THAT COMPLETELY CRUSHED THEIR SKULLS.\n\n   2.  THIS ABSURD MASSACRE AND THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS AGAINST HEAVILY\nPOPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR AND SAN MIGUEL HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY\nALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND, AND ARE PART OF\nA COUNTERINSURGENT PLAN TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND CREATE\nA STATE OF TERROR AMONG THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  PUBLIC DEATH THREATS\nWERE MADE AGAINST PRIEST IGNACIO ELLACURIA OVER THE ARMED FORCES\nNATIONAL NETWORK.\n\n   THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, 15 NOVEMBER, THE SECURITY CORPS SEARCHED\nTHE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS LOOKING FOR THE LEADERS IN ORDER\nTO KILL THEM.  THIS IS THE SAME SCHEME THEY USED IN 1979 AND 1980 WHEN\nTHEY MURDERED MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND MASSACRED THE REVOLUTIONARY\nDEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR FELIX ULLOA, AND TENS\nOF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.\n\n   3.  THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE ARENA [NATIONALIST\nREVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] REGIME AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nFASCIST BEASTS THAT HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON\nDEMOCRATIC PEOPLES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO PROTEST SUCH AN\nUNFORTUNATE MASSACRE, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ISOLATE\nTHE FASCIST REGIME OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI.\n\n   4.  WE CALL ON THE ARMED FORCES OFFICERS WHO KNEW FATHER IGNACIO\nELLACURIA -- AND RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS PAST HISTORY IN THE FIELDS OF\nEDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRUE SITUATION --\nTO TAKE A DIGNIFIED AND DETERMINED STAND AND NOT STAIN THEIR HANDS\nWITH THE BLOOD OF GENOCIDE.\n\n   THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST PATRIOTS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO DO\nNOT HAVE TO SINK WITH THE CRIMINALS.  WE OFFER THEM OUR HANDS, SO THAT\nTOGETHER WE WILL SAVE THE COUNTRY, AND SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE\nPART OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES\nASSASSINATED THE JESUIT PRIESTS, BUT THEY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.\n\n   5.  THE FMLN CONDEMNS THIS CRIME AND JOINS IN THE SORROW OF THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO LOSE IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER SOME OF THE MOST\nAPPRECIATED INTELLECTUALS OF OUR COUNTRY.  THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND\nSENSIBILITY WERE ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN OUR\nSOCIETY.

WE HAVE MADE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THAT MERELY\nTELL US HOW THINGS HAPPENED.

THEY WILL CERTAINLY MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LOCATE HIM SO\nTHAT HE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE\nINCIDENT.\n\n   I SUPPOSE THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL WILL HOST A NEWS CONFERENCE.  YOU\nHAVE MANY OF THE DETAILS, SO WE ARE GOING TO SKIP THEM.  THE ONLY\nTHINGS WE HAVE FOUND ARE FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE BEING STUDIED AND SHELL\nCASINGS FROM AK-47 AND M-16 RIFLES.  WE WILL SUBMIT THEM FOR BALLISTIC\nTESTS.  WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT FORENSIC TESTS, WHICH WILL BEGIN SOON.\nANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL IS THAT INSIDE THE BUILDING THERE WAS A ROOM\nOR LIBRARY WITH VIDEO CASSETTES.  IT WAS LIKE A STUDIO.  THIS ROOM\nLOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN BURNED AFTER BEING RANSACKED.  ALL THESE\nTHINGS AND OTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE\nINVESTIGATORS.  WE ALSO TALKED TO THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL AND TOLD HIM\nTHAT WE WERE DETERMINED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.  WE ASKED HIM\nFOR HIS HELP, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS READINESS TO ASSIST IN THE\nINVESTIGATION.

BRIEFLY,\nBEFORE BEGINNING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY\nBEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS THAT WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST TERMS\nTHE MURDERS OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEIR COOK, AND HER DAUGHTER EARLY\nTHIS MORNING AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, UCA.  WE FEEL THAT\nTHESE INCIDENTS FURTHER COMPLICATE OUR COUNTRY'S CRITICAL SITUATION.\nGROUPS OR MINDS WANT TO HAMPER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE\nPEACE PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS TRIED TO ADVANCE\nAND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE.\n\n   FROM THE START WE ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT\nNOW THAT THE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS HAVE\nSUPPORTED THE PEACE PROCESS, IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE\nHAVING THESE SAVAGE INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE THAT ARE AIMED AT BLOCKING\nTHIS PROCESS.  WE HAVE MADE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS THAT MERELY\nTELL US HOW THINGS HAPPENED.  WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME PROCEDURAL\nSTEPS, SUCH AS [WORD INDISTINCT] WHERE THE IMPACT WAS FELT AND WHERE\nTHE CRIMES WERE PERPETRATED.  IN SUM, WE DID THE THINGS NORMALLY DONE\nAT THE START OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n   THERE IS A POSSIBLE WITNESS TO THESE CRIMES, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, HE\nHAS NOT BEEN LOCATED SO THAT HE CAN BE QUESTIONED BY THE\nINVESTIGATORS.  THEY WILL CERTAINLY MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LOCATE HIM SO\nTHAT HE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL CLARIFY THIS REGRETTABLE\nINCIDENT.\n\n   I SUPPOSE THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL WILL HOST A NEWS CONFERENCE.  YOU\nHAVE MANY OF THE DETAILS, SO WE ARE GOING TO SKIP THEM.  THE ONLY\nTHINGS WE HAVE FOUND ARE FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE BEING STUDIED AND SHELL\nCASINGS FROM AK-47 AND M-16 RIFLES.  WE WILL SUBMIT THEM FOR BALLISTIC\nTESTS.  WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT FORENSIC TESTS, WHICH WILL BEGIN SOON.\nANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL IS THAT INSIDE THE BUILDING THERE WAS A ROOM\nOR LIBRARY WITH VIDEO CASSETTES.  IT WAS LIKE A STUDIO.  THIS ROOM\nLOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN BURNED AFTER BEING RANSACKED.  ALL THESE\nTHINGS AND OTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE\nINVESTIGATORS.  WE ALSO TALKED TO THE JESUITS' PROVINCIAL AND TOLD HIM\nTHAT WE WERE DETERMINED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.  WE ASKED HIM\nFOR HIS HELP, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS READINESS TO ASSIST IN THE\nINVESTIGATION.  WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS HELP BECAUSE IN THE PAST\nCOOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN FORTHCOMING.\n\n   WE HOPE THAT WITH THIS HELP AND WITH THE REMARKS BY MSGR ARTURO\nRIVERA Y DAMAS, WITH WHOM WE ALSO SPOKE THIS MORNING, THIS CASE WILL\nNOT BE POLITICIZED AND JUSTICE CAN BE SERVED, AVOIDING REACHING HASTY\nOR BIASED CONCLUSIONS BY ANY OF GROUP OR PARTY.  WE THINK AND AGREE\nWITH MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS THAT THIS IS HOW A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION\nSHOULD BE CONDUCTED.  WE HOPE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION WILL LEAD US TO\nTHE HEART OF THE MATTER.  REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PERPETRATORS ARE, WE\nWANT PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE ATTEMPTING TO HINDER THE PROCESS OF PEACE\nAND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.\n\n   AND SO WE BEGIN THE QUESTIONS.

THESE ARE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERALL\nCONTEXT, NO MATTER WHO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  LET ME REPEAT: WE HAVE\nCOMMENTS BY CHURCH OFFICIALS WHO WERE GIVING VERSIONS THAT HAVE NOT\nBEEN CORROBORATED.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONS\nWEARING UNIFORMS, TO CITE THESE VERSIONS VERBATIM.  I DO NOT WANT TO\nEXCUSE OR ACCUSE ANYONE, BUT I FEEL THAT IS NOT A CATEGORICAL PROOF.\nTODAY, MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG TO THE ARMED FORCES ARE WEARING\nUNIFORMS.\n\n   LET ME REPEAT: ONE CANNOT SAY ONE THING OR ANOTHER, BUT I DO THINK\nTHIS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.

THIS IS THE QUESTION\nHE WAS ASKED: IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE\nBOMBINGS AND THE BLOODSHED IN OUR HOMELAND.  HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS\nINTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE KILLED IN SAN\nSALVADOR.  THEREFORE, WHAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?  WHAT\nINTENTION DID THE ARMED FORCES' GENERAL STAFF HAVE IN KILLING THE\nJESUITS?  COMMANDER VILLALOBOS REPLIED:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VILLALOBOS] FIRST, IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE\nKILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WAS A HARSH\nBLOW TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.\nTHE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE A SECTOR OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY THAT HAS MADE\nAND CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION.\nTHEY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEBATE, THE NEED TO REASON THINGS OUT, AND THE\nNEED TO HAVE POLITICAL PLURALISM.\n\n   HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, THE [WORD\nINDISTINCT] SECTORS, AND MR. CRISTIANI CANNOT STAND INTELLIGENT\nPEOPLE, THE DEBATES, THE ANALYSES, AND THE PEOPLE'S REASONING.  THIS\nIS WHY THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME.\n\n   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME BECOMES EVIDENT, NOT ONLY BASED\nON DIRECT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY\nUNIFORMED MEN DURING THE CURFEW PERIOD AND THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE\nCRIME A GROUP OF MILITARY MEN CHECKED OUT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE\nGOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME -- CLEARLY INTENDING TO PREPARE A PLAN --\nBUT BECAUSE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE JESUITS MADE OVER THE NATIONAL\nNETWORK.  WE MUST ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS CRIME WAS A POLITICAL\nMISTAKE MADE BY THE DICTATORSHIP.  IT WAS A MISCALCULATION ON THE PART\nOF THOSE WHO MADE THAT DECISION.\n\n   WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO\nSTOP THE FMLN.  THEY COULD NOT STOP THE FMLN PLAN.  ONCE WE BEGAN TO\nIMPLEMENT THE PLAN [1-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] A VERY CRITICAL\nSITUATION.\n\n   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS CRITICAL SITUATION, THEY TOOK THE\nWRONG STEP.  THE DAY BEFORE THE CRIME THE ARMED FORCES BEGAN A\nSTRATEGY TO WEAR OUT THE FMLN, LOGISTICALLY.  WE MUST NOT IGNORE THE\nFACT THAT THE ARMED FORCES' CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION\nTHAT THE FMLN FORCES WOULD BECOME EXHAUSTED.  WE WOULD HAVE MADE A\nSERIOUS MISTAKE IF WE HAD BEGUN THIS PLAN WITHOUT FORESEEING ALL THESE\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES BASED THEIR CALCULATIONS ON\nOUR POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION.\n\n   CONSEQUENTLY, BASED ON THOSE CALCULATIONS, THEY FIGURED THAT THEY\nHAD 3 OR 4 DAYS TO LAUNCH A COUNTERATTACK.  SO, THE DAY PRIOR TO THE\nKILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THEY LAUNCHED SEVERAL OFFENSIVES -- I\nRATHER CALL THEM COUNTEROFFENSIVES -- TO TRY TO DISLODGE US FROM OUR\nPOSITIONS.  THEIR TACTIC WAS TO MAKE US WASTE AMMUNITION.  THEY WERE\nNOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US ABANDON OUR POSITIONS YET.\n\n   HOWEVER, OUR FIGHTERS, IN ADDITION TO SAVING OUR AMMUNITION, HAVE\nTHE MATERIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES SO THEY INFLICTED MANY CASUALTIES ON\nTHE ARMED FORCES AND WORE THEM OUT.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ARMED\nFORCES DID NOT REALIZE THAT AND FELT THAT THEY COULD LAUNCH A BIG\nCOUNTERATTACK TO ANNIHILATE THE FMLN FORCES.  BASED ON THAT, THEY CAME\nUP WITH A PLAN THAT WAS NOT ONLY MILITARY BUT POLITICAL.
