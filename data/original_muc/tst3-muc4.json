[{"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN\nCOMMANDER HANDAL BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [HANDAL]\nWE ARE NOT DEMANDING THAT THEY STOP THEIR OPERATIONS AS A PRECONDITION\nFOR NEGOTIATING.  HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE FACING THE\nSAME SITUATION AS BEFORE, THEREFORE, WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND WILL\nCONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS UNTIL A CEASE-FIRE IS AGREED.\n\n   IN CARACAS WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO NEGOTIATING AND HOLDING TALKS\nIN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CEASE-FIRE AND THE NECESSARY AGREEMENTS FOR THE\nBENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE NATION.\n\n   THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW.  WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING\nWITHOUT THAT GOAL, WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE\nANYTHING.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SITUATION SHOULD\nREMAIN THE SAME.  NOW THERE IS A NEW FACTOR, A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE\nAND REACH AGREEMENTS ON ALL THOSE TOPICS.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT\nTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE AGENDA, THAT THEY ARE\nFULLY AWARE OF ALL THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THAT THEY KNOW THE\nIMPORTANCE OF THE TIMETABLE AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSIONS AND\nNEGOTIATIONS.  YOU JOURNALISTS CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PROBLEM.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] COMMANDER, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE\nFMLN TO JOIN THE PROCESS?\n\n   [HANDAL] LOOK, DEADLINES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT\nNOW. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS TO REACH\nPOLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA\nAGREEMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF\nDEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN\nTHIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME.  THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING\nDEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE\nREACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM.\n\n   THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE\nIN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THOSE\nAGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES.\nEVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED.  EVERY FACTOR\nCONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR\nPERSPECTIVE.  CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE\nCHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM\nTHE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING\nTHE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.\n\n   WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME.\nTHE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE\nARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END.  WE\nBELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES.  AS\nWITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS\nMAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR.\n\n   THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT\nCONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT\nEXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY.\n\n   FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF\nLIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY\nTO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH.  ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE\nFORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE\nINTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  EVERYONE IS\nAWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO\nWERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE\nCASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS\nTHE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY.\n[CONTINUED]", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST3-MUC4-0001", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "1", "INCIDENT: DATE": "-", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "EL SALVADOR", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "-", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "-", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "-", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "-", "PHYS TGT: ID": "-", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "-", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "-", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "-", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-", "HUM TGT: NAME": "-", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "\"JESUIT PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "CIVILIAN: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "PLURAL: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "DEATH: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-"}}, {"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 10 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THOSE ACCUSED OF THE ASSASSINATION OF\nSIX JESUITS WILL HAVE A \"FAIR TRIAL\" AND IF FOUND GUILTY, WILL BE PUNISHED\nWHETHER THEY ARE CIVILIANS, MILITARY, OR INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE, SUPREME COURT\nPRESIDENT DR MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO SAID.\n\n   THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY\nWERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR\nTWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY\nPRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY.\n\n   \"THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN\nJUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF\nTHIS HORRIBLE CRIME,\" DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT.\n\n   GUTIERREZ SAID HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED OR THEIR\nMILITARY RANKS, BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS\nSTILL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS NOT PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE\nTRIBUNAL.\n\n   HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED\nTHAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS \"ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY.\"\nHOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS.\n\n   THE PROSECUTOR SAID THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TEST CONDUCTED BY THE\nCOMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND THE SPECIALIZED POLICE\nWORKING ON THIS CASE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN\nPERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.\n\n   \"THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE WILL PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND\nAGAINST WHOEVER TURNS OUT TO BE GUILTY, BECAUSE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL\nDUTY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,\" COLORADO SAID.\n\n   ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, JUSTICE MINISTER DR OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA,\nPRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS SAID: \"WE\nUNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WAS ANNOUNCED BY\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC A FEW DAYS AGO.\"  HE REFUSED TO MAKE ANY\nFURTHER STATEMENTS.\n\n   NEW UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA\nADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN \"A STEP FORWARD\" BY\nUNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, \"BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT\nTOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES.\"\n\n   ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH,\nDID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, \"BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING\nCONDUCTED.\"  MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER\nSEVERAL.\"\n\n   BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS\nFROM SCOTLAND YARD.

HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE,\nTHE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF\nVIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF \"INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS.\"  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS\nNO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL\nSOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE\nDIALOGUE, ADDING:  \"IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE\nHELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT\nDOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE\nFOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE\nPLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE\nWILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT\nHAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE\nKNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO\nSO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT,\nONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVE\nTHAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR\nYEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN\nOVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S\nPOSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST\nLOGICAL ONE.\"\n\n   TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO\nSOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HE\nSAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO\nREFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME\nGROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A\nPROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN\nELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE\nMAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE\nCONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES\nLIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND\nLARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.\n\n   REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED\nWITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE.\nTO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE\nPOPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO\nOFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE\nTO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE\nTO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND\nFASTER SERVICE.\"\n\n   ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO\nELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED,\nTHAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO\nLIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY\nPROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT\nWITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC\nEXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"\n\n   TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKE\nSHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE\nMEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED\nTHE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO\nCONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC\nBREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START\nELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY\nINCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE\nREST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"\n\n   CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME\nTAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON\nREVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT\nSITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED\nON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND\nMORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME.\"\n\n   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT\nINCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT\nIT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE\nCOUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY.\nREGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY\nVALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN\nEXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO\nARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON.\nEVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO\nPAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO\n1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN\nEXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS.\"\n\n   FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST3-MUC4-0025", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   SANTIAGO, 16 JUL 89 -- [STATEMENT] [CHILEAN SOCIALIST PARTY, PS] [TEXT]\n\n   1. DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE\nDIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME\nMORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL\nFORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS\nMORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A\nFREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR\nORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE\nWORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR\nEXPERIENCES.\n\n   2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL\nSITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES'\nREVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE\nGREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A\nPROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT,\nAND SOCIAL CHANGE.\n\n   3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL\nSOCIALIST [SI] AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN\nTHIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS.\nFIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES\nTHE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW\nDAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE\nCHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL\nASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE\nWHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE\nSI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN\nCAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR\nDEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND\nCOOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS\nAND PROPOSALS PRAISED.\n\n   4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND\nTRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL\nPROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE\nTECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS,\nEXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE\nEMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE\nWORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF\nLIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE\nVALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN\nTHE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS\nFRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS\nIDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A\nBROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN\nAUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE\nACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE\nPLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE.\n[CONTINUED]", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST3-MUC4-0026", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 AUG 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] DANILO BARILLAS, FORMER\nGUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WAS KILLED TODAY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN\nTHIS CAPITAL, THE POLICE REPORTED.\n\n   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, BARILLAS WAS HEADING DOWNTOWN FROM HIS\nHOME IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY WHEN HE WAS INTERCEPTED BY A GROUP OF\nUNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS, WHO SHOT HIM DOWN WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE.\n\n   THE POLICE SAID THAT SO FAR THE IDENTITIES OF THE ATTACKERS ARE UNKNOWN.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST PDC LEADER KILLED SINCE PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO ASSUMED\nPOWER IN JANUARY 1986.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST3-MUC4-0027", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "1", "INCIDENT: DATE": "01 AUG 89", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "GUATEMALA: GUATEMALA CITY (CITY)", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "\"MACHINEGUN\"", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "MACHINE GUN: \"MACHINEGUN\"", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "-", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "\"GROUP OF UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS\" / \"UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS\"", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "-", "PHYS TGT: ID": "-", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "-", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "-", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "-", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-", "HUM TGT: NAME": "\"DANILO BARILLAS\"", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "\"FORMER GUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC]\" / \"FORMER GUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN\" / \"LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC]\" / \"LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY\": \"DANILO BARILLAS\"", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "POLITICAL FIGURE / GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL: \"DANILO BARILLAS\"", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "1: \"DANILO BARILLAS\"", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "DEATH: \"DANILO BARILLAS\"", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-"}}, {"text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 5 AUG 89 (LA VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [NEWS\nCONFERENCE WITH HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYOS BY UNIDENTIFIED\nREPORTERS] [TEXT] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE TOPICS TO BE\nDISCUSSED DEALS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\n[FMLN].\n\n   [AZCONA] I BELIEVE THAT AT THIS SUMMIT THE CENTRAL [WORDS INDISTINCT]. \n\n   [REPORTER] HOW, MR PRESIDENT?\n\n   [AZCONA] WELL, I DO NOT KNOW.

ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLE\nSOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THE\nASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA [WORDS\nINDISTINCT], WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST].  THE COLOMBIAN DRUG\nMAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITH\nPOWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED\nSTATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD.\n\n   YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST], VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ\nSPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, AND\nIT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THE\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IT IS\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES\nPEREZ.  WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US,\nALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA.  WE MUST ALSO\nACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OUR\nTIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARD\nDRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS\nANDRES PEREZ.\n\n   IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERAL\nLATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THE\nSITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATIN\nAMERICAN COUNTRIES.  NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM...[REPHRASES] AS HAS\nBEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT\nFIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BE\nBASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  THAT IS THE MAIN\nSTUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THE UNITED STATES IS\nTHE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUG\nTRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELY\nREPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.

ASKING FOR AN END TO THE\nWAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGED\nWITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR.  IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS IS\nA FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR.\n\n   IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TO\nAGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE.  THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE\nESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS.  THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATION\nOF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND\nSELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE.  THIS CONCEPT\nIS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27\nJULY 1989.

FOR THIS MEETING, WE\nHAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASED\nON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OF\nREPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR\nARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS;\nENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OF\nTHE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OF\nTHE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEAD\nOF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICAL\nAREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.\n\n   AFTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UN AND OAS SECRETARY\nGENERALS' REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SERVE AS WITNESSES AT THE DIALOGUE\nTABLE, CRISTIANI AGREED TO INVITE THEM TO THE COSTA RICA MEETING.

ONE OF\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE\nCOMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND\nSOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT\nHAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  THESE DEMANDS\nARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN\nRIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND\nEFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING\nTORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE\nAGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE\nDEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND\nSINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO\nCONVERT THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER] INTO AN AGENCY OF THE\nARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE\nUNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL.  JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFT\nAND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECT\nPHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S DEMANDS\nCONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN?\n\n   [INZUNZA] THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE\nNEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OF\nTHE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FOR\nVICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY AND\nCOMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OF\nCONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING\nTRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BY\nTHE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI.\nALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN,\nAND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS\nWAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENT\nSTRIKE BY COAL MINERS.

THE DISSOLUTION\nOF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE\nMAJORITY OF CHILEANS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA,\nON THE DICTATOR'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP\nIT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND?\n\n   [INZUNZA] I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS.  THE\nINTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE\nDICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT\nVIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I\nUNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACED\nBY CNI] AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE\nTHE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.

THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES\nWANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS\nVIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE TRANSFER OF\nTHE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS\nACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES.  LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE\nHERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF\nCRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE\nMEN.  THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS\nTRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MAN\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATOR\nHIMSELF.

THERE IS NO GOING BACK.  WE HAVE BROKEN\nTHE DEFENSIVE LINES OF THE ENEMY.  WE HAVE BROKEN [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nIN THE CAPITAL CITY, WE ARE FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE DENS OF COLONEL\nPONCE AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAVE TURNED THE WAR INTO A BUSINESS.\nTHOSE OFFICERS HAVE LUXURIOUS MANSIONS IN MIAMI.  EVERY WEEKEND AND\nEVEN IN SPITE OF THE WAR, COL PONCE HAS ORGIES IN HIS LUXURIOUS HOMES\nIN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  SOLDIERS, PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WE CALL ON\nYOU TO JOIN THE PEOPLE AND JOIN OUR FRONT.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WHO\nARE LISTENING TO US, DO NOT ALLOW MORE BOMBINGS IN OUR CAPITAL CITY BY\nTHE GENOCIDAL TANDONA GROUP [1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL].  YOUNG OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS WHO ARE\nBEING KILLED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL\nCITY, WHY SHOULD YOU BE KILLED WHILE DEFENDING PONCE'S MANSIONS?  THIS\nIS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE\nPEOPLE.  WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER.\n\n   JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL.  OVER 500\nHOMES WERE RAZED.  ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH\nOFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS\nWHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE?  YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL,\nMEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO.  PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO\nTALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING\nTO DO WITH LA TANDONA.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT\nIS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK\nYOU.  THE FATHERLAND?  WHAT FATHERLAND?  THE FATHERLAND YOU ARE TOLD\nYOU ARE DEFENDING ARE THE MILLIONS AND THE MANSIONS OF COL PONCE AND\nOF COL ELENA FUENTES.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS: THE TIME IS HERE, TAKE ONE\nSTEP FORWARD.\n\n   WE HAVE MORE REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR: EARLY THIS MORNING, COMBAT\nHAS BEEN RESUMED IN THE FOLLOWING PLACES: ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND LA\nSULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS\nFROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY.  COMBATS ARE ALSO\nREPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST\nINFANTRY BRIGADE.  THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLIS\nAND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTE\nBATTALION.\n\n   IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANA\nRESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE,\nAND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT\nNO. 6 OF SONSONATE.  TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN\nSALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE\nCOUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS HAS YIELDED NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR\nTHE HIGH COMMAND.  IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES\nBETWEEN THE ATLACATL BATTALION AND THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND THE\nNATIONAL GUARD HAS ATTACKED TROOPS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6.\nTHESE ARE LITTLE SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO\nTHE CAPITAL CITY, AND THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY.  THEY ARE\nCLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n\n   CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST\nINFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY\nBRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE\nINTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY?  THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY.  THE SAN\nFRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE.  THE 4TH\nINFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY\nDETACHMENT NO. 1.  THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS\nINTO THE CAPITAL CITY.\n\n   THIS IS A GOOD REPORT.  THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY\nDETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL.  THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THIS\nMORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES.  WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT?  THE SONSONATE\nSOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS GIVES US A GENERAL\nPICTURE OF THE DEFEAT.  IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THE\nLAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEEN\nWIPED OUT.\n\n   ATTENTION, FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE OPENED FIRE WITH THEIR M-60\nMACHINEGUNS AGAINST UH-1H HELICOPTERS THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE\nRESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE OLIGARCHY.  LIKEWISE, A HELICOPTER IS RIGHT\nNOW FLYING OVER THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF OFFICES.  FMLN UNITS\nARE FIRING THEIR ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IN THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL\nAREA.

THE SOURCE DISCLOSED FURTHER DETAILS OF THE\nBUTTERFLY OPERATION.  THE ARMY SOURCE, WHICH OF COURSE REQUESTED TO\nREMAIN ANONYMOUS, CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE THAT CRASHED IN SAN MIGUEL\nBELONGS TO NICARAGUA AND THAT THE PLANE'S REGISTRATION IS YANKEE\nNOVEMBER BRAVO YANKEE KILO.\n\n   THERE ARE NO REPORTS SO FAR AS TO WHETHER ANY RELATIVES HAVE\nCLAIMED THE BODIES OF THE FOUR MILITARY MEN WHO WERE REPORTEDLY KILLED\nWHEN THE PLANE CRASHED.

ANOTHER\nSINGLE-ENGINE CESSNA, WITH REGISTRATION CHARLIE BRAVO PAPA, AND AN\nAERO COMMANDER, WERE ADDED TO THE INVENTORY.  ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE,\nTHE AERO COMMANDER WAS CONFISCATED FROM COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN\nPUERTO CABEZAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY SANDINIST AIR\nFORCE [FAS] PLANES.

HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS.  TO EXPLAIN\nTHIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HAS\nBEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY.  ON THIS\nOCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WE\nWERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGS\nFROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN\nPROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY.  WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY\nCONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY\nIN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM\nMANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS.\n\n   THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE\nMEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN\nGRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR\nTHE FMLN.\n\n   WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN\nAGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD.  HERE IN\nEL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER\nTERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY\nWITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF\nINTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS.\n\n   IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE\nCAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS\nDOCUMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION AND\nPACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA.  IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULAR\nGROUPS, BE IT THE URNG [GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY] IN\nGUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAY\nTRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA.\n\n   WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALL\nTHE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATER\nUNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN\nTHE REGION.\n\n   [MODERATOR] RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO.\n\n   [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOL\nMEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND.  IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENT\nORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE\nDEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOR\nOF NICARAGUA.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO\nHOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME\nISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL?\nON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT\nOF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS\nUNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A\nFACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED\nREVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC\nPROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING\nTHE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE\nCOMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE\nDEFENSE.\n\n   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT\nTHE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF\nTOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.\nTHIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN\nPOLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.

THE MAIN REASON IS THE\nVERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED\nCRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT\nHAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE\nBRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN\nPOPULATION.  LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED\nNATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE,\nESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, EL\nSALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE\n96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.\n\n   WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS\nTHAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE\nDICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THIS\nWAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.\n\n   TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL\nORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTH\nAMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE\nGENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN\nSPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.\n\n   THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL\nKNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE\nCOUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.\n\n   THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF\nINTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.\n\n   UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST\nTHAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF\nGUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT\nOF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THIS\nDOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nJOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN\nAMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS,\nWERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA\n-- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING\n-- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.  THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN\nALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND\nIN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS\nACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT\nWAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI\nPREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE\nHONDURAN PRESIDENT.\n\n   AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL\nREGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE\nBULL BY THE HORNS.\n\n   LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS.\n[CONTINUED]", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST3-MUC4-0076", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "1 (OPTIONAL)", "INCIDENT: DATE": "- 13 DEC 89", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "EL SALVADOR", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "-", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "-", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "\"GOVERNMENT\"", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "REPORTED AS FACT: \"GOVERNMENT\"", "PHYS TGT: ID": "-", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "-", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "-", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "-", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-", "HUM TGT: NAME": "-", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "\"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "CIVILIAN: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "PLURAL: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "DEATH: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-"}}, {"text": "   BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] IN VIEW OF\nTHE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TODAY IN WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON\nFREDDY, AND SEVERAL OF HIS BODYGUARDS WERE KILLED, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO\nTODAY CALLED AN URGENT COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION\nAND RECEIVE A FULL REPORT FROM MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES.

WE HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE\nPANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN LIMA, OUR SURPRISE AND STRONG PROTEST\nOVER THAT DECISION.\n\n   3.  IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED\nTO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TO\nMAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL.\nPERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF\nPROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILE\nTHE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTED\nIN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS\nON 28 MARCH 1954.\n\n   PERU IS CONTACTING THE MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR\nCONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT [GROUP OF EIGHT] TO EXPLAIN THE\nSITUATION AND TO ASK FOR SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION IN OVERCOMING THIS\nMOMENTARY CRISIS.\n\n   THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY\nHAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TO\nENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED.  WE HAVE TALKED\nWITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR\nCONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT.  I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH\nTHE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA.\n\n   I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS:\n\n   [REPORTER] MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THE\nPEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICAL\nREFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS.  WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?\n\n   [LARCO COX] THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS.  WE\nHAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES.  WE\nHAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA OR\nTHE UNITED STATES.  OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEM\nARE FACING ANY TRIALS.  THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD.  WE SEE THIS\nAS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT?\n\n   [LARCO COX] IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHAT\nTHEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.  ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS,\nCHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATION\nTHAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT.  THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOT\nMADE ANY DECLARATIONS.  HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS IN\nPANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKING\nRETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  HE COULD NOT THINK OF\nANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR\nALLEGED STATEMENTS.  SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION\nBECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB.  BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGING\nTO ONE OF THE EMBASSY'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE IS\nNO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.\n\n   [REPORTER] ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS\nDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION?\n\n   [LARCO COX] YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.\n\n   [REPORTER] IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OF\nITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA?\n\n   [LARCO COX] WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLING\nA HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE.  OUR FIRST\nRESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM IS\nRESPECTED.  AS LONG AS THE REFUGEES REMAIN IN THE EMBASSY, WE WILL\nMAINTAIN OUR REPRESENTATION AT THE LEVEL OF FIRST SECRETARY.

WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION\nMR PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS AS\nA MEDIATOR.  THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE\nTHE NEGOTIATION EFFORT.  ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE\nHAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT.\n\n   2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC\nLEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN\nTHE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE\nPERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE\nDIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT\nIS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY'S\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES.  FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THE\nDIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNED\nINTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES.\n\n   3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICY\nBASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS.  THIS POSITION,\nSIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER [DATE OF THE\nBEGINNING OF THE FMLN MILITARY OFFENSIVE] WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TO\nGREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION.\n\n   4.

ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM\nALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]\nREPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW\nTO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY\nTHE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND\nCHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG\nHAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE\nHE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE\nWASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.\n\n   ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS\nPREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE\nRESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY\nOFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY\nEIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE\nMUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT\nSUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS.\nMEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT\nNEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO\nSUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE\nGUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S\nINTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.\n\n   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH\nEVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE\nGOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE\nEYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO\nDEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IF\nSERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY\nPOLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED.

IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE\nALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR\nRESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE\nSITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST\nENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO\nINFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING\nTHE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS\nPARTY.

WE MAINTAIN OUR\nSTANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY AND\nINDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\nTHE FMLN CONDUCTS.

PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA SAID\nAT A RALLY THAT HE WILL WAGE A CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION.  HE SAID THAT\nTHE REVOLUTION DID NOT DIE WITH THE ELECTIONS.  HE SAID THAT THE\nSANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE\nSENSE A PRETTY COMPLEX CLIMATE FOR THE TRANSITION IN NICARAGUA.  WHAT\nDO YOU THINK ABOUT DANIEL ORTEGA'S STATEMENTS?  HOW DO YOU VIEW THE\nPOSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE A TRUE TRANSITION FROM POWER TO POWER\nINSTEAD OF A TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, STATEMENTS BY ORTEGA AND OTHER\nREPRESENTATIVES OF THE SANDINIST FRONT ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN.  THEY\nCOULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST,\nBUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS\nCONCERNED.  THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELY\nPICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEM\nBEST.  I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TO\nTHE FSLN.  THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION IN\nNICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA.  THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUS\nEXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION.  THE FSLN\nHAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\nTHE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO [NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION], THAT\nIS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN.  YET, THE\nPEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTS\nTHAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DO\nTHAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY.  LET ME REPEAT: THERE IS\nNOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY.  THE\nARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC\nPROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY.  WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVE\nNOT BEEN SETTLED YET.

THE MESSAGE READS AS\nFOLLOWS:\n\n   CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER IS A MONSTROUS CRIME THAT HAS CUT SHORT THE\nLIFE OF A MAN WHO HAD SHOWN HIS WILL FOR PEACE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO\nCOLOMBIA.  THE CRIME WAS DIRECTED AT HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE\nELECTORAL PROCESS AND DESTROYING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT AND M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED,\nSURPASSING MANY OBSTACLES.  IN THIS CASE, AS IN MANY OTHERS, THIS\nPAINFUL TRAGEDY SHOULD SERVE TO CONSOLIDATE THE IDEALS OF PEACE AND\nPLURALISM FOR WHICH SO MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE STRUGGLED -- ONE OF THEM,\nCARLOS PIZARRO.  IT SHOULD SERVE TO REASSERT OUR REPUDIATION OF\nVIOLENCE AND OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES.\n\n   FURTHER ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE NOTES:\n\n   PIZARRO'S RELATIVES AND HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT, AND\nI PERSONALLY, FEEL STRONG WRATH AND SADNESS, BUT WE WILL NOT BE\nDISCOURAGED.

IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO\nTESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAINING\nCOURSES ABROAD.

ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMON\nTHEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT,\nRETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES.  GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLY\nSENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL;\nTHIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROM\nALL ARMED FORCES UNITS.\n\n   CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT.  I\nBELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE\nTO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE.  TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY ARE\nBROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUST\nTESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE?  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.
