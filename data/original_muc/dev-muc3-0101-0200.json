[{"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 30 OCT 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [TEXT]\nPRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID POSITIVE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED DURING\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN COSTA RICA.  ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS,\nCRISTIANI SAID, IS THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL\nTALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD BILATERAL\nTALKS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND TO BRIEF THEM ON THE PEACE\nPROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE, AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE\nPEACE PROCESS.  THE PRESIDENTS RECEIVED FIRSTHAND INFORMATION ON THE PEACE\nPLAN AND ON THE RESULTS THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS FROM THIS PROCESS [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].  I BELIEVE WE HAVE RECEIVED GREAT SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE\nPROCESS.  AS A COUNTRY, EL SALVADOR HAS RECEIVED THE LATIN AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS' SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE SUPPORT OF THE\nSOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS WITH WHOM WE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD\nBILATERAL TALKS. [END RECORDING]\n\n   REGARDING THE COFFEE PROBLEM, CRISTIANI SAID THE PRESIDENTS NOTED THE\nNEED FOR REACHING AGREEMENTS ON THE COFFEE PACT AND THE PRICE OF COFFEE.\nHE ADDED THAT DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT HE CONDEMNED, IN THE PRESENCE\nOF ALL PRESIDENTS, THE AID NICARAGUA GIVES TO THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE\nSANDINIST GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI STATED.\n\n   CONCERNING THE RECENT ATTACKS BLAMED ON THE GUERRILLAS, PARTICULARLY\nTHE 30 OCTOBER ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND, CRISTIANI SAID THIS IS\nREGRETTABLE BECAUSE CIVILIANS ARE MORE AFFECTED BY SUCH ATTACKS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THIS INCIDENT TAKES PLACE AT A TIME WHEN\nTHE FMLN IS TRYING TO SHOW ITS STRENGTH.  THE FMLN IS ALSO TRYING TO\nPROVOKE SOME REACTION FROM THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THE ARMY, IN A GIVEN\nMOMENT, EXERTS PRESSURE TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  I THINK THIS IS\nTHE REASON FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. [END RECORDING]\n\n   CRISTIANI ADDED THAT SUCH ATTITUDES WILL NOT HINDER THE DIALOGUE\nPROCESS IN VENEZUELA.

THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE RECENT FENASTRAS\nMASSACRE, WHICH WE BELIEVE CANNOT BE IGNORED.  THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER\nATTACK, LIKE THE ONES WE ARE USED TO, BUT AN ATTACK THAT SIGNALS A NEW\nPOLITICAL ERA SIMILAR TO THOSE WHEN AN ELECTORAL MASSACRE OCCURRED, WHEN\nMSGR ARNULFO ROMERO WAS MURDERED, WHEN OTHER CRIMES MARKED NEW STEPS IN THE\nNEW FASCIST ESCALATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOW LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI,\nCOLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND THE GREAT EXECUTIONER AND PERPETRATOR OF\nMASSACRES, ELENA FUENTES.  THE MAIN THING IS THAT THE FASCIST MILITARY\nDICTATORSHIP, HEADED BY A SMALL ARMED FORCES GROUP, HAS BEEN EXPOSED.  WE\nDO NOT THINK THIS CAN BE IGNORED.  THE STATE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAVE\nTO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE.  THIS PRICE IS COL PONCE'S RESIGNATION, WHICH IS\nNOW DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] AFTER THE ATTACK, INSTEAD OF SEEKING A DETENTE, THE ARMY, ON\nTHE CONTRARY, CONTINUED ITS PROVOCATIONS.  FOR INSTANCE, SEVERAL\nPLAINCLOTHES MEMBERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nFENASTRAS AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT TOOK THEM PRISONER.  MORE THAN 30 OF\nTHEM WERE DETAINED.  WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE POLICE RELEASED A\nCOMMUNIQUE SAYING THEY WOULD STATION ANTIRIOT POLICEMEN AT THE NATIONAL\nCEMETERY.  WE ALSO HEARD COL MAURICIO VARGAS SAYING THAT, IF THE DIALOGUE\nDOOR IS CLOSED, IT HAS TO BE KICKED OPEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE\nSITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS?\n\n   WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY\nBRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION\nOF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION\nWITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.  WE THINK THIS INDICATES [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nBEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.  IT IS A\nMINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR\nMOVEMENT.  THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE\nPROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT\nTHE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT.\n\n   [REPORTER] WITH LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE\nARENA [NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE?  WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE?\n\n   [SANCHO] I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND\nTHE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,\nAS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES.\nTHE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH\nTO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE\nOPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY\nTAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE\nSURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION.  THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE\nRIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING\nGREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.\n\n   [REPORTER] THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT\nIN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD\nIN THIS STRUGGLE.  WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT,\nESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS?\n\n   [SANCHO] ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO\nFENASTRAS.  I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST\nCONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE\nCREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY,\nTHEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL\nGRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT.  FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS\nSAY--ON THE WARPATH.  IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE\nELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN\nTHE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH.  THE COST IS POLITICAL.  IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT\nTHIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION.  THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS\nBEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN\nINTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nAND TO ACHIEVE OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM.

A FRAUD WILL TAKE PLACE IN A MILITARIZED COUNTRY,\nWHERE MORE THAN HALF OF THE MUNICIPAL OFFICES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING, AND WHERE\nTHE MILITARY MANIPULATES THE BALLOT BOXES, VOTES, AND RESULTS -- AND THEY\nWILL DO IT AGAIN, AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE.\n\n   WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO SUPPORT THE\nPEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND REJECT THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, URGING THEM TO FIGHT\nAND REJECT THE ATTEMPTS TO TURN THE ELECTIONS INTO AN INSTRUMENT TO CONTINUE\nTHE WAR, URGING THEM NOT TO VOTE OR TO VOID THEIR BALLOT.  THE ELECTIONS\nWILL ATTEMPT TO LEGITIMIZE THE WAR, AND THEY WILL BE HELD IN THE MIDST OF A\nWAR.  THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE BOMBING CIVILIANS; THE POLICE WILL BE\nCAPTURING, TORTURING, AND ASSASSINATING; THE JAILS WILL AGAIN BE FILLED WITH\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS.  PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE WILL BE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY\nHIGH COMMAND BY WAVING THE SPECTER OF GENOCIDE OVER THE POPULATION; THIS\nAMID THE DRAMATIC POVERTY OF THE DEPRIVED MASSES.

THOSE ELECTIONS WERE MARKED BY ABSTENTION AS A\nRESULT OF THE REJECTION OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT [FMLN] PEACE PROPOSAL.  THOSE ELECTIONS WERE HELD WHILE THERE\nWAS A WAR AND WHILE THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED.  THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THE\nDUALITY OF POWER THAT EXISTS.  THIS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE MAJORITY\nOF THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE WAR.  WITHOUT\nNEGOTIATION, NO ONE CAN RULE IN EL SALVADOR.  THEREFORE, A MILITARY\nSOLUTION OR THE SURRENDER OF THE FMLN IS NOT POSSIBLE.  THE FUTURE\nGOVERNMENT HAS TWO OPTIONS: TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL INCREASE THE\nWAR OR TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL MOVE TOWARD PEACE.\n\n   THE FMLN JOINS ALL THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES THAT EXPRESSED\nTHEIR CONCERN FOR ARENA'S COMING TO POWER.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ITS [WORD\nINDISTINCT] CAMPAIGN IN WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS\nMODERATES.  IN LESS THAN 20 DAYS, AND WITHOUT FORMALLY ASSUMING POWER, THERE\nHAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AND SOCIAL TENSION, AS HAS BEEN EXPRESSED\nIN DOZENS OF MISSING PERSONS, MURDERS, AND ARRESTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.\nLABOR UNION OFFICES AND THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS HAVE BEEN CORDONED\nOFF; CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS; GRENADES AND BOMBS\nHAVE BEEN EXPLODED IN PUBLIC PLACES; AND THE FMLN IS BLAMED FOR THOSE\nATTACKS.  JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED; THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMATIC\nINTIMIDATION OF THE PRESS AND ATTEMPTS TO CURB FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; AND\nMEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS LINKED TO ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HAVE BEEN RELEASED\nFROM PRISON.  THERE HAVE BEEN THREATS OF SEIZING LAND THAT BELONGS TO\nCOOPERATIVES; THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND\nFOREIGN TRADE WILL BE PRIVATIZED AND THAT MANY GOVERNMENT WORKERS WILL BE\nFIRED.  THERE IS A CLIMATE OF TERROR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THIS CLIMATE\nOF TERROR IS THE RESULT OF THE ARROGANCE AND THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE ON THE\nPART OF ARENA AND SECTORS OF THE ARMED FORCES.  ARENA HAS CLEARLY STATED\nTHAT IT WILL HAVE A POLICY OF KILLINGS AND TOTAL WARFARE AND HAS GIVEN NO\nSIGN OF WANTING PEACE.\n\n   IT IS URGENT THAT AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR DIALOGUE BE CREATED.

CEASE ALL KILLINGS, ARRESTS, DISAPPEARANCES, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS ON\nCIVILIANS; IT MUST RESPECT THE PRESS AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PUT AN\nEND TO MILITARIZATION OF WORKPLACES, MILITARY CORDONS, AND ALL REPRESSIVE\nACTIONS PERPETRATED BY THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEATH SQUADS.\n\n   2.  ARENA MUST RESPECT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND\nAGRARIAN REFORM.  IT MUST ENSURE THAT COOPERATIVES' PROPERTY WILL BE\nRESPECTED; THAT THERE WILL BE NO APPROPRIATION HEARINGS INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE BENEFITED FROM AGRARIAN REFORM; AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ECONOMIC\nMEASURES AIMED AT FORCING THOSE PEOPLE INTO BANKRUPTCY OR INTO SELLING THEIR\nLAND.

THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL\nTHAT HAPPENS IN THE COUNTRY.

WHY?  \n\n   [CEPEDA] IN COLOMBIA THE DIRTY WAR STEMMING FROM THE AMERICAN TACTICS OF\nSO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT IS INTENSIFYING.  THE INTERNAL POLITICAL\nCRISIS IS DEEPENED BY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL DRUG SMUGGLING CLANS\nAND THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP WHICH IS CONDUCTING THE DIRTY WAR.  IN THE SANTA\nFE II DOCUMENT, FORMULATING FUTURE UNITED STATES POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA, IT\nIS EVEN SAID THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES INTERVENES IN THE 1990'S COLOMBIA\nWILL BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR AND ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE.  THE SO-CALLED\nEXTERMINATION OPERATION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONDOR PLAN, IS DIRECTED AGAINST\nTHE COMMUNIST PARTY AND UP, AGAINST THE UNIONS, BUT ALSO AGAINST PRIESTS WHO\nPREACH LIBERATION THEOLOGY, AND RECENTLY THIS HAS INTENSIFIED.  IN COLOMBIA\nSOME ELEMENTS OF FASCISM OPENLY MANIFEST THEMSELVES.  THIS IS MANIFESTED IN\nHUGE AND UNPUNISHED MASSACRES AND IN THE POWERLESSNESS OF PRESIDENT BARCO\nAND HIS CIVILIAN MINISTERS WHO ARE NOT MANAGING TO KEEP THE MILITARY\nLEADERSHIP IN CHECK, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE\nARMED FORCES.\n\n   [POSLEDNI] SOMETIMES PARTISANS ARE ALSO ACCUSED OF TERROR.  \n\n   [CEPEDA] THAT IS ONE OF THE TRAITS OF AMERICAN POLICY -- TO TERM ANY\nKIND OF REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE, OF STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND THE\nPEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AS TERRORISM.  THEREFORE, IT ALSO LABELS THE SANDINISTAS\nIN NICARAGUA AS TERRORISTS AND THE CONTRA REBELS AS FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY\nTHIS I DO NOT WANT TO SAY THAT THE PARTISANS DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALSO\nCRITICIZE THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDEMNED THE DESTRUCTION OF OIL PIPLINES\nBY THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN).\nWE DO NOT AGREE WITH KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS IN EXCHANGE FOR RANSOM.

WHY?  \n\n   [CEPEDA] IN COLOMBIA THE DIRTY WAR STEMMING FROM THE AMERICAN TACTICS OF\nSO-CALLED LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT IS INTENSIFYING.  THE INTERNAL POLITICAL\nCRISIS IS DEEPENED BY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL DRUG SMUGGLING CLANS\nAND THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP WHICH IS CONDUCTING THE DIRTY WAR.  IN THE SANTA\nFE II DOCUMENT, FORMULATING FUTURE UNITED STATES POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA, IT\nIS EVEN SAID THAT UNLESS THE UNITED STATES INTERVENES IN THE 1990'S COLOMBIA\nWILL BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR AND ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE.  THE SO-CALLED\nEXTERMINATION OPERATION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONDOR PLAN, IS DIRECTED AGAINST\nTHE COMMUNIST PARTY AND UP, AGAINST THE UNIONS, BUT ALSO AGAINST PRIESTS WHO\nPREACH LIBERATION THEOLOGY, AND RECENTLY THIS HAS INTENSIFIED.  IN COLOMBIA\nSOME ELEMENTS OF FASCISM OPENLY MANIFEST THEMSELVES.  THIS IS MANIFESTED IN\nHUGE AND UNPUNISHED MASSACRES AND IN THE POWERLESSNESS OF PRESIDENT BARCO\nAND HIS CIVILIAN MINISTERS WHO ARE NOT MANAGING TO KEEP THE MILITARY\nLEADERSHIP IN CHECK, ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE\nARMED FORCES.\n\n   [POSLEDNI] SOMETIMES PARTISANS ARE ALSO ACCUSED OF TERROR.  \n\n   [CEPEDA] THAT IS ONE OF THE TRAITS OF AMERICAN POLICY -- TO TERM ANY\nKIND OF REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE, OF STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND THE\nPEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AS TERRORISM.  THEREFORE, IT ALSO LABELS THE SANDINISTAS\nIN NICARAGUA AS TERRORISTS AND THE CONTRA REBELS AS FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY\nTHIS I DO NOT WANT TO SAY THAT THE PARTISANS DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALSO\nCRITICIZE THEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDEMNED THE DESTRUCTION OF OIL PIPLINES\nBY THE COLOMBIAN PARTISAN ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN).\nWE DO NOT AGREE WITH KIDNAPPING CIVILIANS IN EXCHANGE FOR RANSOM.  WE\nANNOUNCED THAT, AS LONG AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO END THE CONFLICT, IT IS\nNECESSARY TO HUMANIZE IT AND TO RESPECT HUMAN LIVES.
