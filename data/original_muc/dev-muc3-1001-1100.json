THUS FAR, DURING\nTHIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT -- WHICH HAS GIVEN TO EL SALVADOR AND THE\nWORLD REAL HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE FOR OUR COUNTRY -- 401 OF THE\nMOST GENEROUS AND BRAVE SONS OF OUR HOMELAND HAVE FALLEN IN COMBAT.\nTHIS LIST IS HEADED BY OUR DEAR AND UNFORGETTABLE COMRADE COMMANDER\nDIMAS RODRIGUEZ, TO WHOM WE OWE DECISIVE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CONDUCT\nOF OUR STRUGGLE TOWARD VICTORY.\n\n   THE FOLLOWING MILITARY COMMANDERS WHO FELL IN COMBAT ALSO MADE A\nCONTRIBUTION: JORGE ORLANDO SANDOVAL CERVELLON, COMMANDER OSCAR;\nJEHOVA VASQUEZ, COMMANDER CIRILO; OVIDIO LOPEZ, COMMANDER ORLANDO\nMORALES; COMMANDER MISAEL GALLARDO; COMMANDER NICOLAS ALBERTO SARAVIA,\nWILBERT; COMMANDER RICARDO MIRANDA, ESTEBAN RUIZ; AND THE COMMANDER\nODIR POLITICAL DIRECTORS [RESPONSABLES] -- JOSE SANTOS YANEZ, PEPE;\nAND MILAGRO ALVARADO, JUDY.\n\n   WE RELEASE THE NAMES OF THESE HEROES IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO\nREGISTER THEM ETERNALLY IN THE HIGHEST PLACE IN OUR HISTORY.  THEIR\nDEVOTION MULTIPLIES AND STRENGTHENS THE PEOPLE'S POWER.  HUNDREDS OF\nNEW FIGHTERS ALREADY HAVE THE WEAPONS AND ENTHUSIASM OF THOSE WHO HAVE\nFALLEN.  THEY ARE AT THE FRONTLINE OF THIS POWER OF THE FUTURE WHICH\nIS BUILDING, BEFORE THE WORLD'S ADMIRING EYES, DEMOCRATIC AND JUST EL\nSALVADOR.\n\n   ALONGSIDE OUR HEROES, THOUSANDS OF OTHER SALVADORANS HAVE\nFERTILIZED THE PATH TO PEACE WITH THEIR BLOOD, VICTIMS OF THE FATALLY\nWOUNDED BEAST -- THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION\nFEDERATION) UNION MEMBERS, THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ANONYMOUS\nPEOPLE MASSACRED IN THE GENOCIDAL BOMBINGS.\n\n   THE REALIZATION OF A GENUINE AND DEFINITIVE CHANGE IS ENSURED BY\nTHE GREAT POWER OF OUR REVOLUTIONARY ARMY, OF ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, AND\nOF WORLD SOLIDARITY.

WE WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL OUR OFFENSIVES HAVE CENTERED AROUND\nTHE MAIN CITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND\nSIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS STRUGGLE BY THE PEOPLE AND THE FMLN\nIS HAVING MAINTAINED THE BESIEGEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL\nAND ECONOMIC POINTS, MOST ESPECIALLY ON THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL.  THERE\nHAS BEEN GREAT PRESSURE IN THE CASE OF SAN SALVADOR, AND THE FMLN HAS\nFORCED THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, COLONEL PONCE, AND THE FASCIST HIGH\nCOMMAND TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGIC TACTICS THREE TIMES.\n\n   YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FIRST TRIED TO\nDISLODGE THE FMLN FORCES THAT HAD ENTERED SINCE THE EVENING OF 11\nNOVEMBER.  WHEN THE FIRST PUPPET ARMY STRATEGIC DEFENSE TACTIC FAILED,\nTHEY THEN TRIED TO ISOLATE THE FMLN FORCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND\nANNIHILATE THEM ONE BY ONE.  FOR THIS, THEY CONCENTRATED SPECIAL\nFORCES, ESPECIALLY USING ELITE BATTALIONS, IN A SIEGE MODALITY FOR\nANNIHILATION.  THIS ALSO FAILED.  FACED WITH THE SECOND FAILURE OF\nTHEIR SPECIAL TACTICS TO END THE OFFENSIVE IN A FEW DAYS, AS CRISTIANI\nAND THE HIGH MILITARY COMMAND HAD SAID, THEY MOVED A GREAT NUMBER OF\nOPERATIONAL FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR, SUCH AS THE ELITE\nBATTALIONS, TO SET UP AN EXTENSIVE SIEGE TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL CITY\nAND PREVENT OUR FORCES FROM ENTERING IT.  AS ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nABLE TO SEE -- AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO\nVERIFY THIS THROUGH A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FLOWING THROUGH\nINTERNATIONAL REPORTERS -- THAT SIEGE TO KEEP OUT THE FMLN HAS ALSO\nFAILED.  THIS MEANS MORE VICTORIES AND SUCCESSES, SUCH AS INCURSIONS\nINTO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SOUTHERN AREA OF ANTIGUO\nCUSCATLAN, AND TWO IMPORTANT ATTACKS ON THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.\n\n   RIGHT NOW WE SEE THAT THE PUPPET ARMY'S SPECIAL CITY OPERATION IS\nTHEIR THIRD AND LAST PLAN.  THEY HAVE FORMED FOUR COMMANDS TO CONTROL\nTHE CITY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE DEFEATED BY OUR FMLN MILITARY FORCES.  WE\nALSO MUST ADD TO THIS LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THE GREAT\nCONCENTRATION OF ENEMY ARMY OPERATIONAL FORCES IN THE CAPITAL HAS\nCAUSED A GREAT NATIONAL IMBALANCE IN FORCES.  THIS MEANS THAT\nEXTENSIVE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE\nPUPPET TROOPS.  WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON\nORGANIZING THE PEOPLE AND RAISING A PEOPLE'S POWER, AN ALTERNATIVE TO\nLOCAL REACTIONARY POWER.\n\n   WE ALSO RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE DURING THIS FIRST MONTH\nTHE FACT THAT OUR ENEMY'S INTELLIGENCE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETELY\nSMASHED.  THE SEARCHES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED IN AN IMPROVISED\nMANNER TO MILITARY TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITIES, ESPECIALLY THE\nREPRESSIVE CORPS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE ALL THE INTELLIGENCE DATA\nBANKS TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE.  WE MUST\nALSO RECORD AS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF OUR GENERAL OFFENSIVE DURING\nTHIS FIRST MONTH THE FACT THAT THE PUPPET ARMY WAS FORCED TO ABORT\nANOTHER PLAN.  EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SOME BLOODY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE\nMURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, ALONG WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF KIDNAPPINGS\nAND MISSING PEOPLE AND ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF GRASSROOT\nPEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS, WE FEEL THAT THE ARMY AND REPRESSIVE CORPS ARE\nINCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO THE FMLN OFFENSIVE AND THE BESIEGEMENT AT\nTHE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THEIR ANNIHILATION OF\nTHE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.  SO THIS IS ANOTHER SUCCESS.

ON THE SAME NIGHT THE GUERRILLAS\nLAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE OFFENSIVE \"TO ELIMINATE FASCISM.\"  ABOUT 8,000\nGUERRILLAS SWIFTLY CAPTURED MANY TOWNS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS\nNORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL AND CUT KEY COMMUNICATIONS LINES BETWEEN THE\nCAPITAL AND THE HINTERLAND.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ALSO ATTACKED SOME\n50 GOVERNMENT ARMY BASES AND POLICE STATIONS IN THE HINTERLAND, THUS\nCONTROLLING 30 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY.  THEY HAVE\nESTABLISHED \"LOCAL PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENTS\" IN 8 OF THE 14 PROVINCES\nTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  DURING THIS PERIOD, THE GOVERNMENT DISPATCHED\nARMORED CARS AND AIR FORCE UNITS TO CARRY OUT COUNTERATTACKS.  THEY\nWANTONLY BOMBARDED THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY\nOCCUPIED BY THE GUERRILLAS.  AFTER 8 DAYS OF FIERCE BATTLE, THE\nGUERRILLAS SHOT DOWN 12 GOVERNMENT FIGHTER PLANES AND HELICOPTERS;\nDESTROYED 34 TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND PATROL CARS; AND CAPTURED A\nLARGE AMOUNT OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION.  SUBSEQUENTLY BATTLES CONTINUED\nIN REGIONS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL CITY.  SINCE EARLY DECEMBER BOTH SIDES\nHAVE ENGAGED IN FIERCE BATTLES IN THE CAPITAL CITY AND THE HINTERLAND.\nTHE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS TO ATTACK THE BUILDING OF THE GOVERNMENT\nARMY GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS, THE U.S.  EMBASSY, AND THE\nPRESIDENTIAL RESTAURANT, WHEREAS THE GOVERNMENT ARMY DISPATCHED PLANES\nTO BOMBARD THE GUERRILLA POSITIONS.  FIERCE BATTLES HAVE ALSO BROKEN\nOUT IN CHALATENANGO, SAN MIGUEL, AND OTHER TOWNS, THEREBY CAUSING\nHEAVY CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY LOSSES.\n\n   THIS WAR HAS DEEP-ROOTED CAUSES.  EL SALVADOR IS A SMALL COUNTRY\nWITH AN AREA OF 21,000 SQUARE KM AND A POPULATION OF 5 MILLION.\nDURING THIS 10-YEAR-LONG WAR, 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND THE NATIONAL\nECONOMY HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DESTROYED.  THE ULTRARIGHTIST NATIONALIST\nREPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] WON THE GENERAL ELECTION EARLY THIS YEAR,\nTHUS AGGRAVATING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE\nGOVERNMENT.  PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, THE GUERRILLAS PUT FORWARD A PEACE\nPROPOSAL DEMANDING SIX MONTHS' POSPONEMENT OF THE ELECTION SO AS TO\nMAKE THEIR PARTICIPATION POSSIBLE.  BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY\nTHE GOVERNMENT.  BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF THE VOTERS DID NOT VOTE, THE\nGUERRILLAS DECLARED IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.\nPRESSED BY DOMESTIC PUBLIC OPINION AND URGED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPEACE AGREEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS HELD TWO ROUNDS OF\nTALKS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.  DURING THEIR TALKS THE GUERRILLAS\nDEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP ITS SUPPRESSION, INTRODUCE\nPOLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND JUDICIAL REFORMS, REORGANIZE THE ARMED\nFORCES, AND PUNISH THE \"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD.\"  THE GOVERNMENT INSISTED\nTHAT THE GUERRILLAS SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS BEFORE REFORMS WERE\nCARRIED OUT.  THE HARD-LINE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT REFLECTED THE\nESTABLISHED POLICY OF THE RULING PARTY, WHICH HAS ALL ALONG STOOD FOR\nRULING THE COUNTRY BY MILITARY MEANS, ADVOCATED THE SUPPRESSION OF\nDEMOCRATIC FORCES, AND SUPPORTED THE \"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD\" IN CARRYING\nOUT ASSASSINATION.  A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT IN CENTRAL AMERICA WAS\nASSASSINATED BY THE SQUAD FOR CRITICIZING THE ULTRARIGHTIST POLICY OF\nTHE RULING PARTY.  RECENTLY THE RULING PARTY SUPPORTED THE\n\"DARE-TO-DIE SQUAD\" IN ATTACKING THE LABOR FEDERATION'S BUILDING.\nTHIS IGNITED THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINED THE PEACE PROCESS IN\nTHE COUNTRY. THE GUERRILLAS ISSUED A STATEMENT ON 12 DECEMBER\nCONDEMNING THE MEETING OF THE FIVE HEADS OF STATE FOR BEING PARTIAL TO\nTHE ULTRARIGHTIST SALVADORIAN GOVERNMENT.  THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT\nTHEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY EFFORT TO DISSOLVE THE GUERRILLA FORCES AND\nWOULD CARRY ON THEIR STRUGGLE.

THERE IS A HARDENING WHEN ONE SLAPS SOMEONE ELSE IN\nTHE FACE.  IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A CONCRETE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION.\nTHERE IS A GREAT ISSUE TO DISCUSS BETWEEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE UNITED\nSTATES.  YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVADE.  WHO CALLED YOU?  ENDARA\nHIMSELF HAD TO SAY -- BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE\nTHINKING, THOUGH A PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE INDIFFERENT -- THAT HE DID\nNOT CALL THEM.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?  PRESIDENT ENDARA SAYS\nTHAT HE DIDN'T CALL FOR THE INVASION.  THIS SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY\nUNDERSTOOD. FOR SOME REASON HE SAID IT.  SO I WOULD NOT CALL IT A\nHARDENING. I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT SHADE OF THE TERM. WE ARE\nENERGIC IN OPPOSING A CONCRETE FACT, BUT WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE\nOF JEFFERSON, OF WHITMAN, OF LINCLON -- THAT GREAT DEFENDER OF HUMAN\nRIGHTS AND RACIAL EQUALITY -- WHAT HAVE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THAT ACT?\nWE HAVE TO RESPECT THE GREATNESS OF THE UNITED STATES. FROM LATIN\nAMERICA, THE UNITED STATES IS SEEN IN VARIOUS WAYS. FOR THE TIME\nBEING, I SEE IT AS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT\nTHAT THE LATIN AMERICANS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\nTHE LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE HAS TO SEEN INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\nTHEN A SOUND RELATIONSHINP WILL EMERGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONTINENTS.\nBECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ROME OF THE MODERN WORLD -- FOR THE\nCAPACITY OF ITS ATOMIC LEGIONS; FOR THEIR HAVING CONCENTRATED SCIENCE\nAND PHILOSOPHY, ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM EUROPE AS THE\nROMANS BROUGHT THEM FROM GREECE; FOR THEIR HAVING GENERATED AN\nEXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGY, AND FOR THEIR BEING A DEMOCRACY -- THE\nUNITED STATES MUST BE RESPECTED.  WE WILL HAVE TO DISTINGUISH ALL THAT\nFROM A PARTICULAR ACT BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS WHY WE SAY\nAMERICANS REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND SAY YANKEE\nTO DEFINE SOME ACTS BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE,\nSIR, THAT THERE IS A HARDENING, AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY\nUNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL THEM\nTHAT I CANNOT SIT AT THE TABLE WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE KILLING\nPANAMANIAN PEOPLE. LET THE MINISTERS, THE POLICE CHIEFS, THE\nPROSECUTORS, THE ATTORNEY GENERALS SIT AT A TABLE.  THAT IS GOOD.  BUT\nTHE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION?  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? I\nTHINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN IT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT\nWOULD BE A BAD THING FOR MR MANTILLA TO SIT WITH MR BENNETT OR WITH\nTHE JUSTICE MINISTER OF COLOMBIA. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE BAD.\nTHIS IS THE PROOF THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE ANTIDRUG PLAN. BUT\nTHOSE WHO PERSONIFY THE NATION CANNOT MEET.  WE CANNOT DO SO UNDER THE\nPRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  SO THIS IS NOT HARDENING.  AS FOR THE IMF, I\nBELIEVE THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT MATTER.  THESE MATTERS ARE\nWELL DIFFERENTIATED.

[SOCIETY OF JESUS], THE JESUIT PROVINCIAL SPOKESMAN FOR\nCENTRAL AMERICA, HAS RELEASED A NOTE DENYING INEXACT REPORTS ON THE CASE OF\nTHE MURDERED JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT THEY NOT WERE MARXIST GUERRILLA\nSYMPATHIZERS.\n\n   THE NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n   23 DECEMBER 1989\n\n   PROV. 264/89\n\n   DIRECTOR DUTRIZ\n\n   DIRECTOR OF LA PRENSA GRAFICA\n\n   SAN SALVADOR\n\n   DEAR MR.DIRECTOR:\n\n   THE NEWSPAPER WHICH YOU DIRECT, ON 21 DECEMBER 1989, PUBLISHED ON\nPAGES 6 AND 7 TWO ARTICLES ON THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS THAT WERE\nMURDERED ON 16 NOVEMBER.  THESE ARTICLES ARE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY\nTHAT THEY DISTORT THE REALITY OF THE CASE OR THEY INCORRECTLY DESCRIBE\nTHE ACTIVITY OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS.\n\n   ON PAGE 6 AN ARTICLE ENTITLED \"FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE,\" WHICH IS\nSIGNED BY MR. LUIS PAZOS, SAYS THAT \"THE PRIESTS WERE MARXIST\nGUERRILLA SYMPATHIZERS\" AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THEY WORK \"IS\nKNOWN IN EL SALVADOR AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS.\"\n\n   THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF \"THESE PRIESTS' NEOMARXIST-PHILOSOPHICAL\nPOSITION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE.\"\n\n   I WISH TO STATE THAT:\n\n   1. THE MURDERED PRIESTS WERE NOT SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MARXIST\nGUERRILLAS.  THEY ONLY TRIED TO TALK WITH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS IN\nCONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR, SEEKING TO MEDIATE IN AN EFFORT TO FIND PEACE\nWITH JUSTICE.\n\n   2. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR CONSIDER THE UCA [CENTRAL\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY] AS AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER FOR GUERRILLAS,\nBUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE UCA COURAGEOUSLY\nFOLLOWS THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL DOCTRINE.  THIS STATEMENT, IF MADE WITHOUT\nTHE RESERVATION THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE\nAND THE FACT THAT THE ARTICLE FORGETS TO MENTION THE MANY OTHERS DO\nNOT BELIEVE, IS IN OUR OPINION A MANIPULATION OF THE TRUTH.\n\n   3. THE POSITION OF THE PRIESTS WAS NOT \"NEOMARXIST\" IN THE\nPHILOSOPHICAL FIELD.  FATHER ELLACURIA CAME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE\nSPANISH PHILOSOPHER ZUBIRI, WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE DEEPLY ROOTED IN\nCHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.  FATHER AMANDO LOPEZ WROTE HIS DOCTORAL THESIS\nON THE SPANISH PHILOSOPHER AND PRIEST AMOR RUIBAL.  THE \"ZUBIRIAN\"\nINCLINATION OF FATHER ELLACURIA WAS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN IN MOST\nPHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS.  THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE MURDERED PRIESTS OF\nHAVING NEOMARXIST PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS ARE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING\nTHEIR IGNORANCE.\n\n   4. STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE, WHICH WERE REPEATED IN OTHER MEDIA\nBEFORE THE MURDER OF THE PRIESTS, PARTLY PROMOTED THEIR MURDER.

WITH ITS INTERVENTIONIST POLICY, THE UNITED STATES HAS\nNEGATED OUR PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION AND EMBITTERED THE RELATIONS\nBETWEEN THE COUNTRIES IN THE AREA.  BY PREVENTING THE SOCIAL FORCES FROM\nACTING FREELY, THE UNITED STATES PROLONGS THE WAR AND ELIMINATES THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING TRUE DEMOCRATIZATION.  THE U.S. IMPERIALIST POLICY\nHAS WEAKENED IN THE DECADE ENDING TODAY.  LATIN AMERICANISM HAS ADVANCED AND\nTHE TIME OF A DOCILE AND PUPPET CONTINENT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.\n\n   LATIN AMERICAN INTERESTS AND SOCIAL FORCES HAVE MATURED.  DESPITE\n30 YEARS OF INVASION AND COMMERCIAL FREEZING, CUBA IS STILL UNBEATEN.\nNICARAGUA HAS RESISTED, HAS DEFEATED 10 YEARS OF WAR WAGED BY\nMERCENARIES, AND IS PREPARING TO LEGITIMIZE ITS REVOLUTION.  IN EL\nSALVADOR, THE 10 YEARS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY WITH WHICH THE UNITED\nSTATES HAS TRIED TO DEFEAT US AND WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS TRIED TO\nIMPOSE ON US HAVE FAILED.  THE INSURGENCY PROBLEMS THAT WERE\nPREVIOUSLY RESOLVED WITH A FEW ADVISERS AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS\nREMAIN UNSETTLED IN EL SALVADOR DESPITE A $3 BILLION AID PACKAGE,\nNEARLY 1,000 ADVISERS, AND 10 YEARS OF BLOODY WAR.  IN THE PAST THE\nPROBLEM OF PANAMA WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH A COUP IN A FEW HOURS'\nTIME, BUT NOW 2 YEARS OF ECONOMIC FREEZING, SUBVERSION, BUSINESSMEN'S\nSTRIKES, ATTACKS, AND THWARTED COUPS WERE NECESSARY.  FINALLY, THE\nUNITED STATES HAD TO USE 30,000 MEN, DESTROY A COUNTRY, AND FIGHT FOR\n1 WEEK TO BRING TO SUBMISSION AN ARMY AND A MILITARY HEAD THEY\nTHEMSELVES HAD TRAINED.\n\n   LATIN AMERICANISM IS ON ITS WAY FORWARD.  THE DECADE NOW BEGINNING\nBELONGS TO LATIN AMERICA.  THE STRUGGLE IN OUR CONTINENT IS OF AN\nANTI-IMPERIALIST NATURE.  OUR STRUGGLE, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, STARTED IN\nCENTRAL AMERICA 10 YEARS AGO WITH THE TRIUMPH OF THE SANDINIST\nREVOLUTION AND THE BEGINNING OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.  THIS HAS TURNED\nTHE REGION INTO A TRUE VIETNAM DURING THIS DECADE.  BECAUSE OF ALL\nTHIS, THE SACRIFICE THAT OUR STRUGGLE ENTAILS IS GREAT AND THE PROCESS\nIS COMPLEX, BECAUSE BOTH THE STRUGGLE AND THE PROCESS OCCUR IN A\nCHANGING WORLD SITUATION.  WHILE IN EASTERN EUROPE THE AREAS OF\nINFLUENCE ARE DISAPPEARING AND THE PEOPLES' SELF - DETERMINATION IS\nOPENING TO AN UNHINDERED PATH, THE U.S. EMPIRE WALKS IN THE OPPOSITE\nDIRECTION AND CLINGS TO ITS NEOCOLONIAL DOMINATION OF LATIN AMERICA\nAND THE CARIBBEAN.  WHAT IS AT STAKE IN EL SALVADOR IS NOT PRECISELY\nCOMMUNISM OR CAPITALISM, BUT DEMOCRACY AND THE CONTINENT'S\nINDEPENDENCE.  LATIN AMERICA ASPIRES, NOT TO A RESTRICTED SOCIETY, BUT\nTO A SELF-SUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNAL SOCIAL BALANCE WITH THE\nPARTICIPATION OF MANY SOCIAL SECTORS.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SOCIETIES\nAPPEAR TO BE POLARIZED IN THE EYES OF BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS, BUT\nTHE NEED FOR INDEPENDENCE WILL COALESCE ALL OF THESE FORCES.  IN THIS\nCONTEXT, OUR STRUGGLE, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY FOR SELF - DETERMINATION\nAND DEMOCRACY, IS IN THE CAPITALIST WORLD THE SPEARHEAD OF THE\nSTRUGGLE OF ALL LATIN AMERICAN AND THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, WHICH DEMAND\nTHESE TRANSFORMATIONS.  ALL THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE THESE YEARS AND\nALL THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED BY OUR COMBATANTS, MILITARY COMMANDERS,\nPOLITICAL LEADERS, AND THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED EITHER AS DIPLOMATS OR\nGUERRILLAS HAS NOW BECOME VERY SIGNIFICANT.  THE CHANGES IN STRATEGY,\nTHE RESHUFFLING OF PLANS, THE HEROIC RESISTANCE OF THE MASSES, THE\nUNITY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, THE POLITICAL - IDEOLOGICAL\nFLEXIBILITY, THE DEFINITION OF A POLITICAL PLATFORM ADAPTED TO THE\nDEMAND OF THE STRUGGLE, THE LARGE NUMBER OF BOTH LOCAL AND\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND ALL THAT HAS\nBEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE BEST CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE\nCONSTITUTE OUR FULL CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRACY AND\nSOVEREIGNTY IN EL SALVADOR AND LATIN AMERICA AND HELP MAKE THE\nPEOPLE'S VICTORY MORE LIKELY THAN EVER.

I BELIEVE WE MUST ADMIT THAT DESPITE ALL THE\nDIFFICULTIES, THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM, THE MISERY THAT EXISTS ON OUR\nCONTINENT, THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, AND OTHER PROBLEMS, SINCE THE\nLATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS WERE FORMED, OUR CONTINENT HAS NEVER BEEN\nBETTER THAN TODAY.  IN OTHER WORDS, SINCE THE LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS\nWERE FORMED, WE HAVE NEVER HAD ALMOST 90 PERCENT OF THE CONTINENT\nLIVING WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS AS WE DO NOW.  WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE\nPERSPECTIVES WE HAD TODAY.  I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MY\nCOUNTRY, OF LATIN AMERICA, AND ESPECIALLY OF OUR THREE COUNTRIES.\n\n   I AM SO OPTIMISTIC THAT I EVEN WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT\nTOUCHES OUR SOULS.  WE WILL BEGIN THE DECADE BY WINNING THE WORLD\nSOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP IN ITALY.

YOU, LIKE ALL CENTRAL\nAMERICANS, WANT PEACE, BUT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THIS RUNS CONTRARY TO\nTHE FACT THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED RELIABLE PROOF\nOF MILITARY AID [FROM NICARAGUA] TO THE LEFTIST SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS,\nAND RECENTLY, AN ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER SAID THAT\nNICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A SUBVERSIVE GROUP KNOWN AS THE\nCINCHONEROS OF HONDURAS?\n\n   [BORGE] AS FOR THE STATEMENT THAT NICARAGUA IS A SANCTUARY FOR A\nHONDURAN GUERRILLA GROUP, I WISH TO SAY THAT THE STATEMENT IS NOT ONLY\nFALSE, BUT A SERIOUS CHARGE.  I INVITE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME TO\nNICARAGUA, INCLUDING THE HONDURAN AUTHORITIES, TO DO SO.  WE WILL GIVE\nTHEM ABSOLUTE FREEDOM TO SHOW WHERE THE CINCHONEROS CAMPS ARE LOCATED,\nWHERE THEIR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED OR THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE BEING\nCARRIED OUT.  IF THIS EXISTS, IT CANNOT BE HIDDEN.  IT IS VERY\nDIFFICULT TO HIDE A MILITARY TRAINING CAMP.  I ASSURE THE HONDURAN\nGOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WITH A HIGH SENSE OF\nRESPONSIBILITY, THAT NICARAGUA WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR\nGUERRILLA GROUPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH CAMPS IN NICARAGUA,\nESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS HONDURAS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT ABOUT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS?\n\n   [BORGE] MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT EL SALVADOR.  IT IS SAID\nTHAT WE SUPPLY WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN REVOLUTIONARIES.  THIS CHARGE\nHAS BEEN MADE FOR MANY YEARS.  I COULD SAY THAT THE AIRPLANE THAT WE\nDOWNED IN NICARAGUA, FLOWN BY THE FAMOUS HASENFUS, CAME FROM EL\nSALVADOR, BUT WHY BRING THAT UP?  THE FACT IS THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE\nWORLD A POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, KNOWN AS THE CIA, WHICH HAS\nENORMOUS TECHNICAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES THAT CAN ENABLE IT TO\nACCURATELY DETERMINE WHAT IS HAPPENING ANYWHERE, AND YET IT HAS NEVER\nBEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NICARAGUA IS PROVIDING WEAPONS TO ANY\nARMED MOVEMENT ANYWHERE.  THEREFORE, LET US PUT THAT INTO THE SAME\nCONTEXT AS THE STATEMENT THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH CUBA ARE COOLING.  WE\nCOULD ALSO POINT OUT OTHER LIES TOLD ABOUT US.  WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED\nOF ALL KINDS OF THINGS.  WE HAVE BEEN CALLED DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE ARE\nACCUSED OF BURNING DOWN A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA.\nINCIDENTALLY, LET ME TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A JEWISH\nSYNAGOGUE IN NICARAGUA, YET THIS WAS SAID BY NO LESS THAN U.S.\nPRESIDENT REAGAN.\n\n   THUS, THEY TELL ALL THOSE LIES ABOUT NICARAGUA AND THAT IS ONE OF\nTHE THINGS THAT THEY SAY, JUST AS THEY SAY THAT WE ARE THE ENEMIES OF\nHUMAN RIGHTS, THAT WE PERSECUTE CLERGYMEN.  NOTE THAT IN NICARAGUA NO\nPRIEST HAS EVER BEEN IMPRISONED, MURDERED, OR EXILED, EXCEPT ON ONE\nOCCASION BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.  IN NICARAGUA, WE HAVE\nMADE CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORTS TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT THE MAIN\nACCUSATION LEVELED AGAINST OUR COUNTRY IS FAILURE TO RESPECT HUMAN\nRIGHTS.\n\n   WE ARE ACCUSED OF PLANNING ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THERE WAS A POLL DONE\nBY A U.S. FIRM THAT GIVES THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\n[FSLN]...  [CHANGES THOUGHT] I WISH TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS\nNOT A SANDINIST COMPANY; IT MIGHT HAVE VERY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR\nSANDINISM, BUT IT IS APPARENTLY A RELIABLE COMPANY.  IT GIVES THE FSLN\nA MAJORITY OF 51 PERCENT, AND THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION [UNO] --\nONE OF THE POLITICAL FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTORAL CONTEST --\n24 PERCENT.\n\n   OTHER POLLS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HAVE GIVEN THE FSLN CLOSE TO 69\nPERCENT, AS OPPOSED TO UNO, TO WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED 27 PERCENT.  YET,\nWHAT IS BEING SAID?  THAT THERE WILL BE ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THEREFORE,\nTHAT CHARGE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, LIKE THIS ONE WHICH\nGREATLY BOTHERS ME, TO THE EFFECT THAT WE ARE HARBORING SUBVERSIVE\nGROUPS FOR THEM TO COME TO HONDURAS...

HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE, COL VARGAS SAID\nTHAT IF THE AID IS SUSPENDED, THIS WOULD COMPLICATE THE ARMED FORCES\nPLANS CONCERNING THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STRUGGLE.\n\n   [COL VARGAS] I CERTAINLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE, HAVING A\nDEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HAVE SO LITTLE CAPACITY TO DEFEND THE TRUTH.  IT\nCAN TAKE 100 DAYS TO SPREAD A LIE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH IN 1\nDAY.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CONTEXT....[CHANGES THOUGHT] I\nBELIEVE WE ARE OVERESTIMATING THE LEFT-WING ACTIONS.  WE VIEW THEM AS\nBEING SMART, AND WE SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLS.  ANY CUT OR SUSPENSION IN\nTHE AID WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE FURTHER NEEDS\nWHENEVER WE NEED TO FULFILL A MISSION.  THEREFORE, MISSIONS WILL BE A\nBIT MORE COMPLICATED, BUT WE WILL FULFILL THEM.  IF MARXISTS --\nTHROUGH THEIR CONCEPT OF DISINFORMATION -- BELIEVE THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO\nHARM THE UNITED STATES-EL SALVADOR ALLIANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS, AND\nTHAT THIS WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER, THEY ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.  THEY\nWILL FIND AN ARMED FORCES WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO\nDEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.\n\n   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] COL VARGAS, IN CHARGE OF THE 3D MILITARY\nZONE IN SAN MIGUEL, SAID HE AGREES WITH THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE THE\nEIGHT MILITARY MEN, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL AND TWO LIEUTENANTS, CHARGED\nWITH KILLING SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  COL VARGAS SAID THOSE WHO HAVE\nBROKEN THE LAW MUST PAY FOR IT, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.\n\n   [COL VARGAS] THE ARMY WILL FEEL PAIN IN THE EVENT ANY OF ITS\nMEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN ACTIONS WHICH VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES THAT RULE\nTHE ARMED FORCES.  THIS IS VERY PAINFUL.  HOWEVER, IF WE ARE BUILDING\nA DEMOCRACY, THERE ARE FACTS THAT MUST BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO THE\nNORMS PREVAILING IN A DEMOCRACY.  DEMOCRACY MUST PREVAIL OVER PEOPLE.\nDEMOCRACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THAN INSTITUTIONS IN\nINDIVIDUAL TERMS, AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST OF\nPEOPLE OR GROUPS, WHICH CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE NATIONAL INTEREST.\n\n   [CORRESPONDENT VILLARREAL] IN THE MILITARY ASPECT, COL VARGAS SAID\nTHAT AS OF 1990, IN HIS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING\nTHE PLANS DRAFTED BY THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF KNOWN AS \"VICTORY AND\nHAMMER\" WHICH HAS OFFERED, AS PRELIMINARY RESULTS, 53 CLASHES, 37\nGUERRILLAS AND 12 SOLDIERS KILLED, AND WEAPONS SEIZURES.

IT BEGAN WITH THE ARRIVAL IN\nEL SALVADOR OF SEVERAL JESUIT PRIESTS FROM LOVAINA UNIVERSITY IN THE\nEARLY 1960'S AND CONTINUED WITH THE FOUNDING OF UCA [JOSE SIMEON CANAS\nCENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY], THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF\nCERTAIN PRIESTS IN THE SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS, THE AGITATION LAUNCHED BY\nTHE ALAS [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] PRIESTS, THE TRAGIC EPISODE\nINVOLVING MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO, AND THE USE OF THAT EPISODE BY\nTHE LEFT.

DUARTE NEVER\nTRULY DISTANCED HIMSELF FAR FROM THE GUERRILLAS BECAUSE OF HIS\nILL-DISGUISED IDEOLOGICAL LEANINGS, WHICH LED HIM TO COINCIDE IN GREAT\nPART WITH THE SUBVERSIVES' TENETS AND ABOVE ALL WITH THE FANCIFUL IDEA\nTHAT THE PEOPLE APPROVED OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNIST STATE IN\nEL SALVADOR.\n\n   IT IS CERTAINLY DIFFICULT TO COUNTER ORGANIZED SLANDER, TAKING INTO\nCONSIDERATION HOW FAR CERTAIN NOTIONS HAVE GONE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT\nTHEY RECEIVE FROM THE NEWS MEDIA IN A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD.

WE SEE AS POSITIVE THAT MR CRISTIANI HAS ACCEPTED UN SECRETARY\nGENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE NEGOTIATION\nPROCESS IN EL SALVADOR.  WE FEEL THAT THE MEDIATION OF THE UN\nSECRETARY GENERAL AND THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION\nSERIOUSLY COMMIT BOTH PARTIES TO NEGOTIATION AND OFFER TRUE\nPOSSIBILITIES SO THAT THE PROCESS WILL LEAD TOWARD A SOLUTION THAT\nWILL PUT AN END TO THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   2. IN VIEW OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, IT IS HIGHLY NEGATIVE THAT THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY\nASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INCREASED IN THE FORTHCOMING\nFISCAL PERIODS.  IF THIS DECISION IS RATIFIED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, IT\nWOULD MEAN A DEFINITE DETERMINATION TO PROLONG THE WAR AND THE FAILURE\nOF THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE\nSALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THE ASSISTANCE STRENGTHENS THE EXTREMISTS.  THE\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE MAKES IT NECESSARY TO TAKE POLITICAL ACTIONS AND\nSTRENGTHENS THE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.\n\n   3. THE ARMY CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT PERMANENT MILITARY OFFENSIVES\nAND REPRESSION.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE A STATE OF SIEGE, MURDERS,\nARRESTS, AND PERSECUTION AGAINST PEOPLE'S AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS;\nTHE PRESS CONTINUES TO BE CONTROLLED; AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS\nCONTINUE TO BE VIOLATED AS THE EVACUATION OF FMLN WAR CRIPPLES IS NOT\nALLOWED.\n\n   COL PONCE OPENLY PROCLAIMS HIS \"VICTORY AND HAMMER\" OFFENSIVE\nAGAINST FMLN POSITIONS.

AS LONG AS THERE\nARE REPRESSION AND LARGE MILITARY OFFENSIVES, AND A CEASE-FIRE IS NOT\nAGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES, WE ARE OBLIGED TO REMAIN AT WAR AND MAKE\nOFFENSIVE USE OF OUR MILITARY FORCE IN ANY PART OF THE NATION TO\nACHIEVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATION THAT WILL FIND A JUST SOLUTION TO THE WAR.\n\n   [SIGNED] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND\n\n   [DATED] 2 FEBURARY 1990, EL SALVADOR", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-1086 (UNISYS/PARAMAX)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 2 FEB 90 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]\n[TEXT] SOME PEOPLE NAIVELY THINK THAT A COUNTRY CURRY FAVOR WITH THE\nU.S. JUST BY BEING DEMOCRATIC.

HOWEVER, ONCE THEY HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS, NOT ONLY\nARE THEY ABANDONED, BUT NOW THEY ARE EVEN KIDNAPPED, JAILED, AND\nSENTENCED.\n\n   THIS HAPPENED TO PEREZ JIMENEZ OF VENEZUELA; LEONIDAS TRUJILLO OF\nTHE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE CIA; SOMOZA OF\nNICARAGUA; AND LATELY NORIEGA OF PANAMA.\n\n   THESE MEN ARE VALUED ONLY AS LONG AS THEY ARE USEFUL TO THE UNITED\nSTATES. ONCE THEY ARE NO LONGER USEFUL, THEY ARE NO LONGER REGARDED AS\nMEN.  APPARENTLY SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENS WITH COUNTRIES.  IF A\nCOUNTRY HAS ANY POLITICAL, MILITARY, OR STRATEGIC VALUE, THAT COUNTRY\nWILL ENJOY WASHINGTON'S PREFERENCE. HOWEVER, ONCE THE INTEREST NO\nLONGER EXISTS, THE AID IS OVER. IF THE INTEREST DECREASES, THE AID\nDECRESES.\n\n   HONDURAS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS POLICY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.\nTHE POINDEXTER TRIAL SHOWED THAT OVER THE SENATE'S OBJECTION, SPECIAL\nAID WAS GRANTED TO HONDURAS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONVERTING IT INTO A\nLEASED TERRITORY FOR CONTRA OPERATIONS.\n\n   THE YEARS IN WHICH OUR TERRITORY SHAMEFULLY SERVED TO SHED BLOOD IN\nONE OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, ARE YEARS IN WHICH HONDURAS WAS\nREGARDED AS A COUNTRY DESERVING MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID.\n\n   WITH THE CHANGE OF U.S. POLICY, AFTER IT ACCEPTED ITS MILITARY\nFAILURE AGAINST NICARAGUA, HONDURAS IS NO LONGER THE APPLE OF ITS EYE,\nACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES.  THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES IS NOT\nONLY GRUDGING ITS AID, BUT IS NOT EVEN GRANTING THE SCANT AID ALREADY\nAPPROVED, UNLESS HONDURAS AGREES TO ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS.\n\n   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE.  SINCE THE UNITED STATES IS THE IMF'S MOST\nIMPORTANT MEMBER AND SUPPORTER, IT HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN THE\nSCREWS ON HONDURAS, AND TO EVEN LET HONDURAS USE UP ITS MEAGER GOLD\nRESERVES UNTIL HONDURAS IS FORCED TO SAY, \"FORGIVE ME, MASTER.\"\n\n   AS WE CAN RECALL, WHEN THE GOLD STANDARD WAS ABANDONED FOR THE\nDOLLAR STANDARD AND SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS, THE IMF, AND OTHER\nMEASURES WERE CREATED, EACH COUNTRY DEPOSITED GOLD RESEVES TO BACK UP\nITS CURRENCY EXCHANGE.  THEREAFTER, ITS MONETARY BACKING WOULD DEPEND\nON ITS RESERVE OF DOLLARS AND OTHER STRONG CURRENCIES.\n\n   THAT IS HOW GETTING FOREIGN RESERVES BECAME THE MAIN CONCERN OF\nNATIONS, IF THEY WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY.\n\n   AS A RESULT OF THE OIL CRISIS, WHICH ON THE ONE HAND SAVED THE\nOIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, AND ON THE OTHER HAND DEALT A BLOW TO THE OIL\nIMPORTERS, PLUS THE UNCONTROLLED FOREIGN DEBT THAT THE PETRODOLLARS\nBOOM BROUGHT WITH IT, THE COUNTRIES WENT TO THE HILT IN DEBT.  AT THE\nSAME TIME THEY LOST HUGE SUMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF\nTHE DROP IN THE PRICES OF COFFEE, SILVER, TIN, COPPER, AND OTHER\nEXPORT PRODUCTS.\n\n   IN SHORT, THE SOURCE OF EXCHANGE DECREASED FOR EVERYONE, EVEN\nTHOUGH PRODUCTION OF EACH ITEM INCREASED.  DEBTS GREW UNTIL THEY\nBECAME NIGHTMARES THAT ABSORBED ALMOST ALL THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN\nINCOME.  THE MONETARY RESERVES THAT WERE BACKING THE CURRENCIES FELL.\nTHAT IS WHY IN LATIN AMERICA THERE HAS BEEN ONE DEVALUATION AFTER\nANOTHER, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY.\n\n   IN THE BEGINNING THE IMF USED WHAT WAS CALLED A STAND-BY LOAN, WHICH\nHELPED COUNTRIES WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF RESERVES.  WITH THOSE EMERGENCY\nLOANS THEY COULD MAINTAIN THE PARITY OF THEIR CURRENCY, UNTIL THEY COULD\nBALANCE THEIR RESERVES.\n\n   HOWEVER, COUNTRIES LIKE HONDURAS, WHICH WERE DEEPLY INDEBTED, BEGAN\nTO FILL THEIR LACK OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVES WITH LOANS AND DONATIONS.\nEVEN SO THE COUNTRY CONTINUED TO PAY ITS IMPORTS AND EXPENSES IN\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE, UNTIL IT REACHED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WHICH WE\nCANNOT PAY THE DEBT. WE ARE OVERDUE $140 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON OUR\nDEBT. OUR CREDIT IS NO LONGER GOOD. THE IMF HAS NO MORE MONEY TO GIVE\nTO HONDURAS TO CONTINUE ITS VICIOUS CYCLE OF GETTING INTO DEBT TO PAY\nOFF ITS DEBTS.  YET THE UNITED STATES HAS ASKED THE IMF TO TIGHTEN OUR\nSCREWS.

THE COCA GROWERS ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW DAYS\nAGO STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT AGAINST THE ERADICATION OF COCA\nPLANTATIONS BUT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE AGRARIAN BANK'S UNSATISFACTORY\nSERVICE IN GRANTING LOANS.  THIS COMMUNIQUE WAS PUBLISHED BY THE MEDIA\nA FEW DAYS AGO.\n\n   [GARCIA] YES, WE HEARD ABOUT THIS AND ARE ANALYZING IT.  BUT THE\nPROBLEM OF THE 200,000 HECTARES USED FOR ILLEGAL COCA GROWING BY FAR\nEXCEEDS THE CAPACITY OF THE AGRARIAN BANK, OF THE NATIONAL COCA LEAF\nENTERPRISE [EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LA COCA], OR THE ENCI TO FINANCE\nFERTILIZER.  THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED AT THE\nCONTINENTAL LEVEL.  THE HUALLAGA VALLEY IS AN ENCLAVE OF THE U.S.\nCONSUMERS.  IT IS A PERVERSE PROBLEM WITH ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS AND\nIT IS DISTORTING AND DESTROYING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR PLANTING OTHER\nCROPS IN THAT AREA.  THIS IS WHY WE MUST CONSIDER IT FROM A\nCONTINENTAL VIEWPOINT, DISCUSSING IT WITH THE COUNTRY WHERE THE\nPROBLEM ORIGINATES, WHERE IT IS CONSUMED.  THE ENCI AND THE AGRARIAN\nBANK PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT, BUT IT IS VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE\nSERIOUSNESS OF THE OVERALL PROBLEM.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IS IT TRUE -- AS IT WAS SAID IN THE\nUNITED STATES -- THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO REPLACE\nTHE PLANTATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY CONVENIENT?\n\n   [GARCIA] NO, ACCORDING TO SOLID INFORMATION I HAVE AT HAND FROM THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, OUR\nGOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE GREATEST EFFORTS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS TO\nERADICATE COCA PLANTATIONS.  A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY RELEASED A REPORT\nTO THE U.S. MEDIA FROM MAY 1989 THAT SHOWED THAT PERU HAD BROKEN ALL\nRECORDS FOR ERADICATING COCA IN 1988, IN KEEPING WITH ITS\nINTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.  PERU ERADICATED MORE THAN 5,000 HECTARES OF\nCOCA PLANTATIONS THAT YEAR, THUS STABILIZING THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF\nHECTARES USED FOR COCA GROWING.  NOBODY, MUCH LESS THE UNITED STATES,\nCAN SAY THAT PERU HAS DONE NOTHING.\n\n   WE HAVE CARRIED OUT VAST OPERATIONS AND HAVE CONTINUED OUR SILENT\nTASK TO ERADICATE THESE PLANTATIONS, SOMETIMES WITH REGRETTABLE\nCONSEQUENCES.  THE PEASANT WHO IS FACED WITH BARE LAND AFTER THE COCA\nIS UPROOTED EITHER ENGAGES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OR IS CONDEMNED TO\nLIVE IN MISERY.  THIS IS WHY WE NEED AN OVERALL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL\nDEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVE THAT MUST BE PART OF A REEVALUATED LATIN\nAMERICAN-U.S. RELATIONSHIP.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, THE SITUATION IS NOW THE OPPOSITE TO WHAT\nTHE UNITED STATES IS DOING FOR [WORDS INDISTINCT] A MEETING PUT\nFORWARD BY THE PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE THEY GIVE $1 TO FIGHT DRUG\nTRAFFICKING WHILE THERE ARE $100 FOR CONSUMPTION.\n\n   [GARCIA] YOU ARE RIGHT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TOTAL COST OF\nCOCAINE SOLD ON THE U.S. STREETS IS $100 BILLION.  ONLY $8 OR $9\nMILLION IS BEING OFFERED TO FIGHT THE ILLEGAL PRODUCTION OF COCA AND\n TO REPLACE THE CROPS HERE IN PERU.  WHAT THE UNITED STATES -- THE       \nMAIN CONSUMER -- HAS BEEN OFFERING IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE\nMAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM.\n\n   IF THERE WERE NO CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES, PERU WOULD NOT\nPRODUCE COCA LEAVES, EXCEPT FOR THE TRADITIONAL, ANCIENT USES OF\nPERUVIAN PEOPLE.  THE PROBLEM BEGINS THERE.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nPROVIDING MASSIVE RESOURCES SHOULD BE ASSUMED THROUGH CONCERTED\nDIALOGUE, NOT UNILATERAL MEASURES, BECAUSE THERE ARE HAWKS IN THE\nUNITED STATES.  THE HAWKS ARE THE BOLDEST MILITARISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT\nTROOPS CAN BE SENT TO THE HUALLAGA VALLEY, THUS SOLVING THIS SERIOUS\nPROBLEM.\n\n   SUCH AN ACTION WOULD REPRESENT THE VIOLATION OF A NATION'S\nSOVEREIGNTY, AN UNWANTED UNILATERAL INTERVENTION.

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GENERATED FROM THE SALES OF\nTOBACCO CAN BE USED TO PAY BACK SOME OF TEGUCIGALPA'S FOREIGN DEBT.\nTHE REPAYMENT WILL EARN MORE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT, WHICH IN TURN\nSUPPORTS OTHER PROJECTS OF DEVELOPMENT.\n\n   THE PRESENCE OF A U.N.
