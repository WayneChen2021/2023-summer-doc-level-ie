WHAT\nOPTIONS DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE CONCERNING EL SALVADOR, AND WHAT\nIMPACT HAS THE NEW SITUATION HAD ON U.S. POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR?\n\n   [SAMAYOA] AS I SAID, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE INTO\nCONSIDERATION THAT A NEW INTERNAL SITUATION OF GENERALIZED POPULAR,\nPOLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DISCONTENT IS TAKING SHAPE, AND THAT FROM THIS\nMOMENT ON ITS POLICY IN EL SALVADOR WILL UNDERGO ISOLATION AND WILL BE\nREJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND EVEN BY VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS\nWITHIN THE HOUSE AND SENATE.\n\n   SO FAR, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS STUBBORNLY CONTINUED PROVIDING\nAID AND SUPPORT TO A REGIME THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CRIMINAL AND GENOCIDAL,\nAND THAT POLICY IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CURRENTLY A VERY STRONG DEBATE\nIN THE UNITED STATES.  THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT\nARE TO SINK WITH THE CRISTIANI REGIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING\nTOWARD DEFEAT AND MILITARY AND POLITICAL DESTRUCTION DESPITE ALL THE\nPROPAGANDA IT HAS MADE, OR TO CHANGE ITS OPINION WHILE THERE IS STILL\nTIME.  THE ALTERNATIVE OF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, A REPLACEMENT OF\nCRISTIANI'S REGIME OR THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, IS ALREADY UNDER\nDISCUSSION.  THESE, THEREFORE, ARE THE TWO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO\nTHE UNITED STATES: EITHER CHANGE ITS POLICY IN TIME AND REPLACE\nCRISTIANI, OR THE GOVERNMENT WILL SINK BECAUSE ITS PROPAGANDA IS NOT\nWORKING.\n\n   THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.  HE SAID THE\nGUERRILLAS HAD 1,500 MEN IN SAN SALVADOR, AND HE HAS LISTED CASUALTY\nFIGURES ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FMLN SUFFERED OVER 500 DEATHS, OVER 400\nWOUNDED, AND OTHERS CAPTURED.  ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES QUOTED BY THE\nU.S. AMBASSADOR, WHO PROVIDES GOVERNMENT WAR BULLETINS AND HAS ALMOST\nBECOME THE SALVADORAN DEFENSE MINISTER, THE FMLN ONLY HAS 200 MEN LEFT\nIN SAN SALVADOR.\n\n   WHAT I FIND INEXPLICABLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO USE 40 OR 50\nWAR PLANES AND HELICOPTERS, ALONG WITH ITS ARTILLERY AND ELITE\nBATTALIONS, TO BOMB AND DESTROY CITIES, ESPECIALLY SAN SALVADOR.  THAT\nIS WHY THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS BACKFIRED ON THEM.

IN AT LEAST 20\nCITIES IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED ALL THEIR\nREPUDIATION AND INDIGNATION OVER THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S.\nPOLICY IN EL SALVADOR.\n\n   SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THE UCA PRIESTS, A LARGE NUMBER OF\nIMPORTANT U.S. SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THAT U.S.\nMILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE\nCUT AND SUSPENDED.  SENATOR KENNEDY IN PARTICULAR MADE A VERY STRONG\nSTATEMENT, SAYING THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' ATTITUDE SIMPLY\nEXPRESSES THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF U.S. POLICY -- WHICH HAS BEEN\nSPENT FEEDING, TRAINING, ARMING, AND FINANCING AN ARMED FORCE THAT\nCARRIES OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO SENATOR KENNEDY, THERE ARE\nMANY U.S. SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE REQUESTING THE TOTAL\nSUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR.  AT THIS TIME, THE\nCRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF\nREPUDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE\nU.S. GOVERNMENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE\nWHITE HOUSE CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE [SALVADORAN] CRIMINAL\nREGIME AND GIVING IT FURTHER EMERGENCY AID.\n\n   [REPORTER] COMRADE, YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT ARTICLES PUBLISHED\nIN THE MAIN U.S. NEWSPAPERS THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON\nPOST, WHICH STRONGLY QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT\nCRISTIANI, THE CHIEF OF THE FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.  WHAT IS THE\nSITUATION OF THE CRISTIANI SPEECH AND HIS ALLEGED LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY\nIN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?\n\n   [SAMAYOA] THE ALLEGED LEGITIMACY OF CRISTIANI COLLAPSED.  IN THE\nUNITED STATES, THEY SAID CRISTIANI WAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAD GOOD\nINTENTIONS, BUT THE RIGHT-WING [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND THE DEATH SQUADS\nDID NOT LET HIM WORK.  THE SPEECH FAILED BECAUSE IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT\nAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES, CRISTIANI IS RESPONSIBLE\nFOR THE GENOCIDE IN SAN SALVADOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY\n[WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE MEDIA HAVE ALSO REPORTED THE ARREST OF U.S.\nRELIGIOUS MEN AND OF SWISS, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND JAPANESE CITIZENS.\nTHE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT ACCUSING EVERYONE OF\nCOOPERATING WITH THE GUERRILLAS, AND THIS HAS CAUSED A TOTAL LOSS OF\nTHE GOVERNMENT'S PRESTIGE. EDITORIALS ON 18 NOVEMBER IN THE MAIN U.S.\nNEWSPAPERS [WORDS INDISTINCT] CRISTIANI IS NOT MORE THAN [WORDS\nINDISTINCT]. AT EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IN MOST COUNTRIES IN WESTERN\nEUROPE -- IN ITALY, SPAIN, THE FRG, FRANCE, SWEDEN, DENMARK AND\nEVERYWHERE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED BY LABOR UNIONS,\nPOLITICAL PARTIES, AND PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO\nEXPRESS REPUDIATION.  IN LONDON, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HUMAN\nRIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, URGED EVERYONE TO STAGE\nDEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF ALL SALVADORAN EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.\n[CONTINUED]", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0814 (PRC)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "1", "INCIDENT: DATE": "- 19 NOV 89", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "EL SALVADOR: CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UNIVERSITY)", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "-", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "-", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "\"SALVADORAN ARMY\"", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "REPORTED AS FACT: \"SALVADORAN ARMY\"", "PHYS TGT: ID": "-", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "-", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "-", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "-", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-", "HUM TGT: NAME": "-", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "\"JESUITS\" / \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"UCA PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "CIVILIAN: \"JESUITS\" / \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"UCA PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "PLURAL: \"JESUITS\" / \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"UCA PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "DEATH: \"JESUITS\" / \"JESUIT PRIESTS\" / \"UCA PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-"}}, {"text": "   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN'S\nROBERTO ROCA BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [ROCA] THE\nGUERRILLA OFFENSIVE HAS NOT BEEN DEFEATED AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED.\nINTERNATIONAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES HAVE\nBECOME STRONG IN THE CITY, THAT THEY ARE MAKING TACTICAL MOVEMENTS,\nAND THAT IN SPITE OF THE BARBARISM WITH WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAS\nBEEN OPERATING, THE GUERRILLAS MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONAL\nCAPABILITIES.\n\n   THE SITUATION CANNOT DEFEAT US.

THE DEFENSE MINISTRY CENSORS THE PRESS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE\nTHE ONES CENSORING THE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND NOT THE ARENA\n[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] FOLLOWERS OR OTHER\nCIVILIANS.  THE GENERAL STAFF, THE SOLDIERS, ARE GAGGING THE PRESS,\nIMPOSING THE STATE OF SIEGE, GIVING THE FINAL ORDERS.  IT IS IMPORTANT\nTO LOOK INTO THIS CLOSELY BECAUSE GEN LARIOS, IN AN EMPTY SPEECH -- WE\nHEARD HIM DELIVER A RHETORICAL AND EMPTY SPEECH -- ACCUSED THE FMLN OF\nKILLING THE PRIESTS AND SAID THAT THE ARMY CONTROLS THE COUNTRY.  WE\nPOINT OUT THESE CONTRADICTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   BY SAYING THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT, THAT THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO\nIT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT HE DID IT, THAT HE IS ONE OF\nTHE KILLERS.  THAT IS WHAT GEN LARIOS IS SAYING, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID\nIN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] NO DOUBT, AND THE\nINTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN\nTHE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE PAST EXAMPLES OF IT.\nWE HAVE MONSIGNOR ROMERO'S CASE AND WE HAVE THE CASE OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, WHO, A FEW YEARS AGO, WERE\nARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT DURING A POLICE OPERATION.  HOWEVER, NOT A\nSINGLE SOLDIER HAS BEEN PUNISHED.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN CRISTIANI'S\nJUSTICE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE AND\nCRISTIANI WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  HE WILL PROBABLY PUT UP SOME\nACT.  THE U.S.  CONGRESS ALSO HAS ITS EYES ON EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE\nDEBATING THE ISSUE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR.  THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THE\nU.S.  CONGRESS MUST THINK ABOUT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SAID\nTHAT IT IS PLEASED WITH THE WAY CRISTIANI ACTED IN THE FACE OF THE\nFMLN OFFENSIVE.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS\nAPPROVED THE DROPPING OF WHITE PHOSPHORUS OVER ZACAMIL AND THE\nDESTRUCTION OF 500 HOMES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\nSTATE HAS APPROVED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, AND ALSO THE\nMASSACRE OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN CITIZENS WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR\nHOMES AND KILLED ON THE SAME BLACK NIGHT WHEN THE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE\nKILLED.

THE LAVA OF THIS ERUPTING VOLCANO IS BOILING,\nMR.  WALKER.  UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE ONE STEP BACK.  ALL\nFOR PEACE.\n\n   WE HAVE BEEN READING THE SUMMARY OF OUR NEWS MONITORING.  U.S.  PENTAGON\nMILITARY OFFICIALS AND MANY NONMILITARY ANALYSTS ARE SURPRISED OVER WHAT\nTHEY CALL THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S OFFENSIVE\nCAPABILITIES.  A REPORT STATES THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS ARE VERY SURPRISED\nOVER THE FMLN MANEUVERABILITY AND OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.  THE FMLN ACTIONS\nOF THE PAST DAYS HAS SPOILED ALL THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SALVADORAN\nMILITARY MEN SENT TO U.S.  OFFICIALS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON THE FMLN\nMANPOWER-WEAPONS RATIO AND OUR MILITARY ABILITY TO OPERATE.\n\n   THE FMLN HAS NEVER LOST ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  SOME ANALYSTS VIEW\nTHE SALVADORAN WAR AS A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  THAT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE\nTHE SALVADORAN WAR IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.  IT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS\nIF IT WERE A REGULAR WAR SUCH AS THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  EL SALVADOR IS LIVING\nTHROUGH CONFLICT THAT IS MAINLY SOCIAL IN NATURE, A CONFLICT THAT IS ROOTED\nIN SOCIAL INJUSTICE.  THE FMLN DID NOT EMERGE FROM A MILITARY SCHOOL WITH A\nREARGUARD IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, BUT IT IS MADE UP OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.\nFMLN COMBATANTS HAVE LEARNED TO FIGHT IN ACTUAL CLASHES.  THEY HAVE GAINED\nGROUND INCH BY INCH; IT HAS ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE.  THE FMLN DOES NOT\nFORCEFULLY RECRUIT PEOPLE.  THEREFORE, IT IS NOT PERIODICALLY RENEWING ITS\nRANKS AS THE ARMY DOES THROUGH FORCEFUL RECRUITMENT.  TO THE FMLN, THE MAIN\nGOAL IS TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE, TO GET AS CLOSE AS IT CAN TO THE PEOPLE.\n\n   BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC\nOPPORTUNITIES IN [EL] SALVADOR, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS HAVE NO OTHER\nOPTION THAN TO TAKE UP ARMS AND FIGHT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS IN\nTHE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL REPRESSION, ECONOMIC INJUSTICE, AND\nUNEMPLOYMENT.  TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION, THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS DECIDED TO\nTAKE UP ARMS AND LEARN TO WAGE WAR BY FIGHTING DAIILY.  THAT IS THE HISTORY\nOF THE FMLN.\n\n   THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT TWO ARMIES ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.\nTHE LOGISTICS APPARATUS OF THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT' [ARMED] FORCES IS NOT\nCOMPARABLE TO OUR FORCES.  THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY TONS OF BOMBS, RIFLES,\nBOOTS, AND MATERIAL THROUGH PORTS AND MILITARY AIRPORTS.  ALTHOUGH THE\nGOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA, CUBA, AND THE USSR COULD HELP THE FMLN, AS MANY\nARE SAYING, THE FIREPOWER OF OUR FORCES COULD NEVER BE COMPARED TO THE\nARMY'S.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN HAS OPENED IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE\n[UNITED] STATES, THE NECESSARY WAYS FOR US TO OBTAIN OUR ARMS AND\nAMMUNITION.  WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS.  HOW DOES THE FMLN LEARN TO FIGHT--\nBY FIGHTING.  WE ARE NOW FIGHTING IN CITIES.  EVERY MILITARY ANALYST KNOWS\nHOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIGHT IN URBAN AREAS.  THE FMLN FIGHTING IN SAN\nSALVADOR, SAN MIGUEL, ZACATECOLUCA, AND USULUTAN HAS SHOWN THE\nORGANIZATION'S TREMENDOUS ABILITY TO WEAR OUT THE ENEMY, TAKE AND HOLD\nPOSITIONS, AND MANEUVER IN THE CITY JUST AS IT HAS DONE IN RURAL AREAS.  THE\nFMLN ABILITY HAS SURPRISED THE MILITARY ANALYSTS AT THE PENTAGON.  OUR FRONT\nHAS ALWAYS HAD THIS ABILITY.  BUT NOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR STRATEGY AND\nTACTICS TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY PLANS.  THE [ARMED] FORCES HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN\nREGARDING THE ACTIONS BY PATROLS [WORDS INDISTINCT], SPECIAL OPERATIONS.\nTHE FMLN HAD TO CHANGE ITS STRATEGY TO STRIKE AT THE SMALL FORCES THAT TRIED\nTO INFILTRATE OUR ZONE UNDER COVER.  ONLY THUS COULD WE ANNIHILATE AND\nDEFEAT THESE FORCES AND THEIR STRATEGY.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID.  THIS IS\nWHAT MUST BE OBSERVED, HOW THE FMLN HAS CHANGED ITS MILITARY STRATEGY TO\nFACE THE ONE USED BY THE [ARMED] FORCES.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE ACCUMULATED\nGREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS, WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THESE LAST DAYS IN\nCOMBAT IN [SAN] SALVADOR AND [SAN] MIGUEL.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS ARE\nBEING DESTROYED IN STREETS AND AVENUES; HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN;\nSOLDIERS ARE BEING TAKEN PRISONER; AND ARMS ARE BEING SEIZED.\n\n    MILITARY ANALYSTS ARE WONDERING HOW A GUERRILLA ARMY CAN OPERATE FOR SO\nLONG IN AN URBAN AREA.  IN ADDITION, LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO\nCONSIDERATION.  THE [ARMED] FORCES ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING AMMUNITION THROUGH\nTHE ILOPANGO [AIR] BASE.  THE FMLN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION\nBECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT.  THOUSANDS OF CAPITAL RESIDENTS COOPERATED\nBY KEEPING SILENT WHEN THEY SAW THE GUERRILLA COLUMNS PASS BY.

MANY OF THEM ARE WAR CRIPPLED AND THEIR RELATIVES, MOST OF WHOM\nARE CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND THE ELDERLY.\n\n   TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE HONDURAN CIVILIAN\nPOPULATION AND TO VIOLATE THAT SECTOR OF HONDURAN TERRITORY WOULD BE A\nBARBARIC ACTION AGAINST HUMANITY.  IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO AN ALLEGED\nRIGHT TO CARY OUT MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST YOUR ARMED OPPOSITION \"NO\nMATTER WHERE THEY ARE,\" I REMIND YOU THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL\nMASSACRE, BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE CIVILIANS AND\nTHE REST ARE DISARMED FORMER COMBATANTS.  THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN\nVERIFIED BY THE CIAV.\n\n   THEREFORE, MY GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE\nNICARAGUAN TROOPS CONCENTRATED IN THE BORDER AREAS WITH HONDURAS.  UP\nUNTIL THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT INCREASED THE NUMBER\nOF TROOPS WHO REGULARLY COMPOSE THE BORDER SECURITY FORCES.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO REPEL ANY\nACTION THAT VIOLATES HONDURAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY\nAND TO CARRY OUT THE CONSULTATIONS IT DEEMS NECESSARY, TO ADOPT THE\nINDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE DEFENSE MEASURES THE SITUATION REQUIRES.\n\n   MY GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS TO STATE THAT IT VIEWS WITH ASTONISHMENT\nTHE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT TO THE\nCOUNTERREVOLUTION -- DURING THE TALKS PROMOTED BY THE CIAV IN THE\nUNITED STATES -- IN THE SENSE THAT THE NICARAGUAN INTERNAL ARMED\nCONFLICT BE SOLVED BY WITHDRAWING THE ARMED OPPOSITION TO HONDURAS.\nTHIS PROPOSAL CLEARLY VIOLATES THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND THE\nAGREEMENTS SIGNED AT THE TELA SUMMIT, WHICH CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR\nDEMOCRATIZATION, NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, DEMOBILIZATION, AND\nREPATRIATION.

THEY ARE THE ONLY TWO WHO SEEK TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN\nIN POWER THROUGH THE RIFLE AND BY WAR.\n\n   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE CANNOT PERMIT OUR COUNTRY, OUR SMALL EL\nSALVADOR, OR OUR NOBLE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO BE THE VICTIMS OF THAT\nCOMMUNIST AGGRESSION WHICH DANIEL ORTEGA AND FIDEL CASTRO SEEK TO\nLAUNCH.\n\n   IN THAT SENSE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN VIEW OF THIS NEW SITUATION, WE\nWANT YOU TO REFLECT ON THAT ARTIFICIAL CEASE-FIRE WHICH THE FMLN\nLAUNCHED A FEW DAYS AGO.  WHAT IS THE FMLN UP TO WITH THAT CEASE-FIRE?\nIT MADE THAT PROPOSAL AFTER IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE CITY THAT IT HAD\nATTACKED.  THE PEOPLE WERE RESUMING THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES AND\nEVERYTHING WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THOSE AREAS.\nWHY DID THEY CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE WHEN THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DEFEATED\nIN THE OFFENSIVE BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO HAD REPUDIATED THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS?  THEY HAD NO REAL OBJECTIVE AHEAD, OTHER THAN TO\nCONTINUE TO DESTROY, TO ASSASSINATE, AND TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE\nTERRORIST ACTIONS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   THEREFORE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT PERMIT ITSELF TO FALL\nINTO ANOTHER TRAP OF THE FMLN.  IF THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND COSTA RICA\nWITH A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE, AS THEY TRIED TO MAKE US BELIEVE, WE\nREALIZE TODAY THAT THOSE ACTIONS WERE JUST ANOTHER FARCE.  THIS\nAGGRESSION WAS NOT PLANNED IN 2 OR 3 DAYS.  THIS AGGRESSION HAD BEEN\nPLANNED SEVERAL MONTHS BACK.

I LATER HEARD THAT THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY HAD MURDERED SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, AMONG THEM A PRIEST\nWHO HAD BEEN DEAN OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY HERE IN NICARAGUA.  IT\nWAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO THINK AND ASKED MYSELF: HOW CAN I WELCOME THE\nPRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR HERE IN NICARAGUA WHEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nSUMMIT IS HELD?  WHAT A PROBLEM.  A REAL PROBLEM.  HOW COULD I WELCOME\nIN NICARAGUA THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS PRIESTS AND\nBISHOPS, THAT KILLED MONSIGNOR ROMERO; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS\nCLERGYMEN, THAT HAS KILLED NUNS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER CHURCHES,\nCATHOLICS AND EVANGELISTS; A GOVERNMENT THAT KILLS WORKERS, PEASANTS,\nLABORERS, AND LEADERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN\n600 CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS.  THEY WERE KILLED BY ARENA\n[NATIONALIST REPUBLIC ALLIANCE], THE RULING PARTY IN EL SALVADOR, AND\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH IS THE SAME THING.  I KEPT ASKING MYSELF:\nHOW CAN I WELCOME THEM IN NICARAGUA?  IT WOULD BE LIKE WELCOMING\nSOMOZA.  ALL I COULD COME UP WITH WAS TO FIND AN EXCUSE NOT TO HOLD\nTHE MEETING.

I\nBELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK CLEARLY BECAUSE DIPLOMATIC\nJARGON CAN SOMETIMES CONFUSE THINGS.  IT IS TIME THAT WE SPEAK\nCLEARLY.  THE LEAST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO IN RESPONSE TO\nTHE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TO ASK AND DEMAND\nOF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD THAT IT BREAK RELATIONS\nWITH THAT MURDEROUS AND CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL THOSE WHO KILLED THE\nPRIESTS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED, UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE KILLING THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUNISHED.

ALL THE\nPEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE BOMBINGS ARE DISSATISFIED PEOPLE WHO WILL JOIN\nTHE STRUGGLE SOONER OR LATER.\n\n   WE REMEMBER THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISPLACED PEOPLE AND REFUGEES\nCAUSED BY THE BOMBINGS IN THE SALVADORAN COUNTRYSIDE.  THE BRUTAL\nATTITUDE OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE HAS LEGITIMIZED THE ARMED STRUGGLE.\nTHE OTHER PARTY, MEANING THE ENEMY, HAD TO GRAB ALL THE RESOURCES OF A\nCONVENTIONAL WAR: AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, AND HEAVY ARTILLERY.  THIS\nLEGITIMIZES THE PEOPLE'S ARMED STRUGGLE AND SELF-DEFENSE.\n\n   A THIRD GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL AND STRATEGIC EFFORT\nEXERTED AGAINST FASCISM HAS BEEN THE LIBERATION OF LARGE ZONES OF THE\nNATIONAL TERRITORY.  A NEW, EMERGING POWER NOW CONTROLS EIGHT\nDEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE ARMY IS SPREAD THIN AND IT HAD TO\nABANDON THE ZONES WHERE IT CANNOT KEEP ITS MEN -- COMPROMISED AS IT IS\nIN THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF THE CITIES.  THIS PUTS THE ARMY THROUGHOUT\nTHE NATIONAL TERRITORY IN A SITUATION RESEMBLING A CLOTH WITH MANY\nHOLES, STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND THREATENING TO RIP AT ANY POINT.\nTHE TEAR CAN OCCUR WHEN LEAST EXPECTED.  LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE ARE\nNOW IN THOSE LIBERATED TERRITORIES, ENGAGED IN A RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT\nAND ORGANIZING A REARGUARD FOR THE MARCH ON THE CITIES.\n\n   THERE IS A FOURTH ELEMENT TO CONSIDER: ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST\nIMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOW A BETTER BALANCE\nFOR NEGOTIATIONS.  ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMANDS AND PROPOSALS AT\nTHE NEGOTIATION TABLE ARE COMPLETELY NULL AND VOID.  THE PRETENSE OF\nDEMANDING THE FMLN'S SURRENDER IS UNTIMELY GIVEN SUCH A SHOW OF\nSTRENGTH.  NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD NOW BE WILLING TO BET ON THAT\nPOSITION.

THE DEBATE ON THE\nCONDITIONING, AND EVEN THE TOTAL SUSPENSION, OF MILITARY AID TO THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY IS VERY INTENSE, AND IT HAS ALREADY SHAKEN THE\nFOUNDATIONS OF BIPARTISANSHIP REGARDING U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE CRISTIANI\nGOVERNMENT.

CRISTIANI\nTRIED TO LOWER THE LEVEL OF THE WATER THAT HAS REACHED HIS NECK BY\nDIVERTING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION FROM THE BOMBINGS AND THE DEATHS OF\nTHE JESUIT PRIESTS TO NICARAGUA.  IN THIS DESPERATE EFFORT, ALL THAT\nCRISTIANI HAS DONE IS TO TAKE THE WAR TO OTHER AND MORE DANGEROUS\nLEVELS.

ABRAMS,\nA FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, STATED: BASED ON 10 YEARS\nEXPERIENCE ON THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, I PRESUME THAT THE DEATH OF THE\nPRIESTS WAS NOT THE WORK OF LEFTIST GUERRILLAS, BUT AN ACTION BY\nFORCES OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION.  WE DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF\nGUERRILLAS TAKING THIS SORT OF ACTION, SAID ELLIOT ABRAMS.

VOA HAS REPORTED THE\nSTATEMENTS BY THE WOMAN WHO WITNESSED THE CRIME.  AT THIS TIME IN THE\nUNITED STATES, THE SALVADORAN TOP MILITARY COMMAND, COLONEL RENE\nEMILIO PONCE, AND PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE BEING POINTED OUT AS\nTHE PERSONS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.\n\n   IN RELATION TO THIS, WE WANT TO DENOUNCE THE FOLLOWING TO THE\nINTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE\nINTERNATIONAL MEDIA.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE CRISTIANI\nADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES\nTHAT IS PRESENTLY CENTERED ON THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND THE\nINVOLVEMENT OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRIME.  WE DENOUNCE\nTHE ARREST OF U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO AS PART OF A SALVADORAN\nARMED FORCES PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL\nPUBLIC OPINION FROM THE JESUITS' CASE.  WE ALSO DENOUNCE THE ARREST OF\nJENNIFER CAZOLO AS A REPRESSIVE ACT.  ALSO, THE ARMED FORCES IS TRYING\nTO LINK HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EL SALVADOR, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND U.S.-BASED\nORGANIZATIONS TO THE FMLN.  IT IS TRYING TO LINK THESE ORGANIZATIONS\nAND THESE PERSONS TO THE FMLN.\n\n   THE FMLN COMPLETELY DENIES THAT IT HAS ANY LINK WITH U.S. CITIZEN\nJENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE DENOUNCE THIS ACCUSATION AS A CLUMSY SET UP BY\nTHE ARMED FORCES COMMAND, WHICH IS TRYING -- WE REPEAT -- TRYING TO\nREPRESS THESE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGNERS.  THIS IS A\nSET UP BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REPRESS FOREIGN CITIZENS AND -- WE\nREPEAT -- IT IS A SMOKE SCREEN TO DIVERT U.S. ATTENTION FROM THE CASE\nTHAT IS PRESENTLY ON THE TABLE.  IT IS A SET UP TO NOT ATTEND THE\nINTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT\nPRIESTS.\n\n   IF ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER-AMERICAN\nAFFAIRS, WHO KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT EL SALVADOR, SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT THE\nFMLN AND THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY MILITARY UNITS AND PERSONS\nLINKED TO THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, HIS STATEMENTS WILL HAVE\nSTRONG REPERCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ARMED FORCES COMMAND\nAND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO\nTHROW A SMOKESCREEN HERE AND THERE TO TRY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF\nTHE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, ESPECIALLY, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED\nSTATES.\n\n   IN CONCLUSION, WE REAFIRM: WE DENY THE ARMED FORCES' ACCUSATIONS\nAGAINST U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CAZOLO.  WE STATE THAT THE ACCUSATION IS\nA CLUMSY SET UP TO HIDE AND NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS\nASKING -- WHERE ARE THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS?

SANDOVAL WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE U.S.  NEWS AGENCY\nUPI.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN PATRIOTS MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THE OAS\nRECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE SALVADORAN SITUATION.  THE RECOMMENDATION\nCALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA\nCHAVEZ OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES.  VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES\nPEREZ HAS ALSO JOINED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP THE\nVIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR.  ON TUESDAY, 21 NOVEMBER, PEREZ MET WITH\nOFFICIALS OF THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, NAMELY JUSTICE MINISTER\nOSCAR SANTAMARIA AND MINISTER OF PRESIDENCY JUAN PADELA.\n\n   ACCORDING TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, HE ALSO TALKED WITH HIS\nSALVADORAN COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE PHONE.  IN THE COURSE\nOF THIS TALK HE OFFERED TO HOST A CARACAS MEETING BETWEEN THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS.\n\n   IT WOULD SEEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF CRISTIANI'S\nADMINISTRATION, ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YIELDED THE EXPECTED\nFRUITS.  THE FACT IS THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO\nWORSEN THE TERROR.  WITH THIS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING A\nLAW TO PUNISH THE OPPOSITION.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, CONGRESS HAS\nALREADY APPROVED ANTITERRORIST BILLS.  THESE BILLS ALLOW THE ARREST OF\nPEOPLE ON SUSPICION OF ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.\n\n   A SALVADORAN DEPUTY HAS LABELED THESE BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND\nCONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  MEANWHILE, THESE BILLS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE\nACURSED DEATH SQUADS.  AMERICAS WATCH, A HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION,\nHAS REPORTED AN INCREASE OF [WORD INDISTINCT], ARRESTS OF AND THREATS\nAGAINST FOREIGNERS WHO WORK FOR RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN\nORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THE CRUSADE\nAGAINST FOREIGN MISSIONARIES IS ENCOURAGED BY THE ULTRARIGHTISTS WHO\nARE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT\nGUARANTEES THE REACTIONARIES THEIR IMPUNITY.\n\n   DEATH SQUADS, WORKING CLOSELY WITH REACTIONARY MILITARY MEN AND THE\nCRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, ARE MOST CERTAINLY TO BLAME FOR THE RECENT\nDISGRACEFUL MURDER OF SIX PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR, ACCORDING TO THE\nU.S. PUBLICATION THE BOSTON GLOBE.  THE PAPER STATES THAT THIS IS\nOBVIOUS TO ALL AND THAT THE SALVADORAN REGIME AND THE YANKEE\nGOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.\n\n   FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THIS ATTITUDE IS REASONABLE.  WASHINGTON'S\nPOLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR IS BASED ON THE ULTRARIGTHWING FORCES [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].  THE BOSTON GLOBE ADDS THAT EVERY YEAR THE TAXPAYERS TAKE\nOUT OF THEIR POCKETS $500 MILLION TO FINANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE\nU.S. GOVERNMENT GIVES TO EL SALVADOR.  SOME OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE\nDEATH SQUADS WHICH ARE GUILTY OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITED AMID\nHELLISH TORTURES.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION.\n\n   THE THING IS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS PREFER TO LASH OUT AT THE\nFICTITIOUS SHIPMENTS OF SOVIET WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR, FICTITIOUS\nBECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE THAT\nSUCCESSIVE SALVADORAN REGIMES HAVE MADE OF U.S. AID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN\nDOWNPLAYED.  HOWEVER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WITHOUT THE HEFTY U.S.\nSUBSIDIES, THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A LONG\nTIME AGO AND THE NEARLY 100,000 SALVADORANS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE\nSTRUGGLE, WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

IN MY OPINION,\nSOVIET DIPLOMACY HAS A MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CURRENT\nSITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED ITS\nCONSERVATIVE STAND, WHICH MADE US SUPPORT JUST ONE SIDE.  IN THE FINAL\nANALYSIS, THE WAR IS A TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, AND THE MAGNITUDE\nOF THE TRAGEDY GROWS AS THE CONFLICT BECOMES MORE SERIOUS.\n\n   THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT WILL REFLECT THE WILLINGNESS THAT MOSCOW\nAND WASHINGTON HAVE TO HELP A SMALL NATION, WHICH IS TIRED OF A \nLONG-STANDING CONFLICT, FIND A WAY TOWARDS PEACE.\n\n   ALL OF US ARE WAITING FOR THE SOVIET-U.S. SUMMIT WHICH WILL BE HELD\nOFF THE COAST OF MALTA.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE ISSUES THAT\nWILL BE ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE THE MEETING WILL BE UNOFFICIAL [AS\nHEARD].\n\n   THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE ADDRESSED IN A BILATERAL SUMMIT.\nIT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH SIDES REACH AN\nUNDERSTANDING AND THAT THEY IDENTIFY THE POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION\nFOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PROBLEM.

SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]\n[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] IN LIGHT OF THE TERRORIST ARMED\nAGGRESSION LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY THE FMLN\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WITH THE OPEN SUPPORT AND\nDIRECTION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA ON 11\nNOVEMBER, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ADVISES THE INTERNATIONAL\nCOMMUNITY THAT ON THE DAY THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT ASSUMED OFFICE, IT\nEXPRESSED ITS FIRM DESIRE TO SEEK, THROUGH THE CIVILIZED PATH OF\nDIALOGUE, A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT BECAUSE THE MARXIST\n- LENINIST GROUP'S CAUSE BRINGS BLOODSHED TO OUR PEOPLE.  IN THIS\nSENSE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT PROMOTED THE PROCESS OF\nDIALOGUE THAT BEGAN IN MEXICO CITY ON 13, 14, AND 15 SEPTEMBER 1989.\nAT THAT TIME, GOVERNMENT AND FMLN DELEGATIONS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT\nCOMMITTING THEMSELVES TO SEEK AN END TO HOSTILITIES WITHIN THE SPIRIT\nOF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN TELA,\nHONDURAS.  BASED ON THE AGREEMENT REACHED IN MEXICO CITY, THE ISSUE TO\nBE BROACHED DURING THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE,\nCOSTA RICA, ON 16 AND 17 OCTOBER WOULD BE THE END TO HOSTILITIES BASED\nON PROPOSALS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.  AT THAT TIME,\nTHE FMLN DID NOT ALLOW THE DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC PREVIOUSLY AGREED\nON AND PRESENTED A SERIES OF PROPOSALS, DELIBERATELY COMPLEX IN FORM\nAND CONTENT, WITH THE EVIDENT PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THE MAIN AND ONLY\nTOPIC ON THE AGENDA FROM BEING DISCUSSED.\n\n   ON 11 NOVEMBER, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AGAINST THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN AGGRESSION THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY PLANNED AT LEAST A\nFEW MONTHS BEFORE IT WAS LAUNCHED.  THIS PROVES THAT WHILE THE FMLN\nWAS TALKING PEACE AND NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, IT\nWAS, WITH THE POLITICAL, LOGISTICAL, AND MILITARY SUPPORT OF ORTEGA'S\nGOVERNMENT, PREPARING THE CRIMINAL ATTACK AGAINST THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE.\n\n   SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION TO DATE, CERTAIN\nTHINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT PROVE THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT\nIN THE GENOCIDE IMPLEMENTED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS. THE SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENT HAS PROOF THAT THE FMLN IS A PUPPET OF DANIEL ORTEGA'S\nDEADLY PLANS WHO, FACED WITH AN IMMINENT ELECTORAL DEFEAT AND IN\nCONJUNCTION WITH FIDEL CASTRO, IS ATTEMPTING TO REGIONALIZE IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA AN ARMED CONFLICT TO TRY TO SAVE THE SANDINIST REGIME.\n\n   IN LIGHT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AND HAVING ESTABLISHED THE\nPARTICIPATION OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT IN THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION\nEXPERIENCED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT\nAGREED, ON 26 NOVEMBER 1989, TO SUSPEND DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL\nRELATIONS WITH THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND RECALLED ITS DIPLOMATIC\nMISSION FOR CONSULTATIONS.  IN LIGHT OF THESE SERIOUS ACTIONS WHICH\nVIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED\nFORMAL CHARGES BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS SO THAT IMMEDIATE\nAND EFFICIENT MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO REPUDIATE\n THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS AND SO THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WILL      \nBE DIPLOMATICALLY AND POLITICALLY PRESSURED TO STOP THE AGGRESSION\nIT HAS UNLEASHED AGAINST EL SALVADOR, AND THUS STOP A POSSIBLE           \nCONFLICT OF UNPREDICTABLE DIMENSIONS.\n\n   HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AT A TIME LIKE THIS, WHEN AROUND THE WORLD\nMOMENTS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM ARE BEING EXPERIENCED IN PLACES LIKE\nPOLAND, THE GDR, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, AND HUNGARY, HERE, IN EL SALVADOR,\nBECAUSE OF THE FMLN'S IRRATIONAL ACTIONS -- WITH ORTEGA'S SUPPORT --\nATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO DROWN A NATION WHICH, DESPITE 10 YEARS OF\nWAR, IS TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS?\n\n   THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE UNITED DURING THIS\nHISTORIC TEST TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0895 (GTE)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] DEPUTY DEFENSE\nMINISTER COLONEL JUAN ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAS SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES\nSTRUCTURE REMAINS INTACT AND THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL\nLIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF LAUNCHING ANOTHER\nOFFENSIVE.
