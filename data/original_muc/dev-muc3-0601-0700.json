ARE YOU SAYING THAT 20 PERCENT, 10 PERCENT OR 50\nPERCENT OF THE CONTRAS HAVE TO BE DEMOBILIZED IN ORDER FOR THE\nCEASE-FIRE TO BE IMPLEMENTED AGAIN?\n\n   [ORTEGA] THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN.\nTHEN, THE NUMBER OF CONTRAS THAT ARE DEMOBILIZED WOULD BE ESTABLISHED\nACCORDING TO THE DECISIONS MADE AT THE UNITED NATIONS.  THAT IS, HOW\nMANY CONTRAS CAN BE DEMOBILIZED RIGHT AWAY, HOW MANY OF THEM WILL BE\nRETURNING TO NICARAGUA, HOW MANY WILL GO TO THIRD COUNTRIES.\nTHEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT THE PLAN IS BEING IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL BE\nWILLING TO REINSTATE THE CEASE-FIRE.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, UP UNTIL LAST WEEK, THE U.S. CONGRESS\nDISCUSSED GIVING MORE AID TO THE CONTRAS.  NO ONE EVEN WANTED TO TALK\nABOUT THE CONTRAS, IT WAS A STALE ISSUE.  HOWEVER, IT HAS BECOME A\nBURNING ISSUE OVERNIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT AID FOR THE\nCONTRAS AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING MILITARY AID TO THEM.  LAST\nNIGHT, THE U.S. SENATE ISSUED A RESOLUTION STRONGLY CONDENMING THE\nNICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT.  MY QUESTIONS ARE: FIRST, WHY HAS THERE BEEN\nSUCH A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE.  SECOND, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO\nTHE U.S. CONGRESS.\n\n   [ORTEGA] U.S. CONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR\nREELECTION.  WITH THE DUE RESPECT THAT SOME OF THEM DESERVE, U.S.\nCONGRESSMEN ARE ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR REELECTION.  I HAVE TALKED TO\nMANY OF THEM HERE AND THEY ARE CYNICAL.  THEY TELL ME: I DISAGREE WITH\nTHAT BUT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO ELECTED ME.  IF THOSE WHO\nELECTED ME HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION, THEN I HAVE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT\nFOR THEIR VIEWPOINTS AND FORGET ABOUT MY OWN OPINION.  LET US NOT\nMISLEAD OURSELVES.  YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW U.S. CONGRESSMEN ACT.\nTHEREFORE, IT WAS EASIER FOR THEM TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE\nCONTRAS AS THEY HAD DONE -- BECAUSE THE CONGRESS HAD APPROVED THE\nSO-CALLED HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE CONTRAS [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND LET\nTHE WAR CONTINUE, AND LEAVE THE BURDEN ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nGOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WHO\nARE SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF THIS WAR.  THEREFORE, WE HAVE BEEN\nREPORTING THE KILLINGS, THE ASSASSINATIONS, THE CRIMES, THE CONTRAS\nATTACKS, AND THE YANKEE CONGRESS HAS REMAINED SILENT.\n\n   THEREFORE, WE SEE AN EASY-GOING ATTITUDE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.\nOBVIOUSLY, WHEN WE ANNOUNCE WE ARE NOT GOING TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE\nTHE U.S. CONGRESS REACTS IMMEDIATELY.  THEY REACT BECAUSE THEY ARE\nFULLY AWARE THAT THEY ARE MEDDLING IN NICARAGUAN POLITICS.  THEY WILL\nHAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE, AND THEY DO NOT\nWANT TO DISCUSS THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AGAIN.  IT WAS EASY TO SET ASIDE\nTHE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND TO SIMPLY APPROVE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS SO\nTHE CONTRAS COULD CONTINUE KILLING NICARAGUANS WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE\nREMAINS CALM -- LET THE PEACE PLAN CONTINUE AS FAR AS IT CAN AND AS\nFAR AS PRESIDENT BUSH ALLOWS IT TO DEVELOP.  THE U.S. CONGRESSMEN CAN\nTHEN FORGET ABOUT THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE AND WORK ON OTHER DOMESTIC OR\nINTERNATIONAL ISSUES IN WHICH THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED.\n\n   HOWEVER, WHEN NICARAGUA SAYS: WE WILL NOT EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE,\nTHEN THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY.  WHY DO THEY RAISE AN OUTCRY?  BECAUSE THEY\nKNOW THEY WILL HAVE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS ON THE NICARAGUAN ISSUE.\nMOREOVER, THERE MIGHT BE A FEVERISH CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL PROPOSE\nGIVING MILITARY AID TO THE CONTRAS.  WELL, LET THEM DISCUSS MILITARY\nAID.  DO THEY WANT TO DISCUSS MILITARY AID, WELL THAT IS THEIR\nPROBLEM.  WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE YANKEE CONGRESS ACTIONS\nWILL EASE OR HINDER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF\nELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY WILL DEPEND NOW ON THE YANKEE CONGRESS AND ON\nTHE YANKEE PRESIDENT.  IT WILL DEPEND ON THEM.  WE HAVE THE DESIRE TO\nDO IT.  HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTIONS ARE HELD ON 25 FEBRUARY\nWILL DEPEND ON THEM.

ON THE DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS\n[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION], THE GOVERNMENT\nSTRONGLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO CARRY OUT A\nTHOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  HOWEVER, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT FENASTRAS\nLEADERS HAVE BEEN HINDERING THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD CLEAR UP THE\nATTACK.\n\n   NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO CARRY\nOUT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, AND WILL EVEN BRING TO THE COUNTRY SOME\nEXPERTS IN THIS FIELD SO THAT WITH THE HELP OF MODERN SCIENCE AND\nTECHNOLOGY THEY WILL HELP THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE CLARIFY THIS\nBLOODY AND CRIMINAL ATTACK AND ESTABLISH WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.\n\n   LIKEWISE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO APPOINT A COMMISSION THAT\nWILL GUARANTEE THE INVESTIGATIONS, AND IT WILL INVITE THE FOLLOWING:\nONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM\nTHE OAS; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SALVADORAN BISHOPS' CONFERENCE;\nONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE POLITICAL PARTIES; TWO LABOR UNION\nREPRESENTATIVES, ONE OF THEM BEING FROM FENASTRAS; DR IGNACIO\nELLACURIA [JESUIT PRIEST AND RECTOR OF THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CENTRAL\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY]; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC; AND THE\nMINISTER OF JUSTICE.\n\n   2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS SUPPLIED EVIDENCE FROM THE\nBEGINNING THAT IT IS SINCERELY SEEKING PEACE.  THE DIALOGUE COMMISSION\nATTENDED A FIRST MEETING WITH THE FMLN IN MEXICO, AND ACCEPTED A\nCOMMITMENT, AS FOLLOWS, AND I QUOTE: BOTH PARTIES COMMIT THEMSELVES\nNOT TO WITHDRAW UNILATERALLY FROM THE DIALOGUE.\n\n   THE FMLN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF\nTHE MEXICO AGREEMENT, BUT ALSO [WORD INDISTINCT] THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE'S HOPES FOR PEACE.  FAR FROM SUSPENDING THE DIALOGUE, THE FMLN\nSHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN\nEVER IN ORDER TO HALT THE BLOODSHED.\n\n   3.

THE\nFMLN ANNOUNCED IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS TRIP TO CARACAS, BUT CRISTIANI\nSAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL GO TO CARACAS REGARDLESS OF\nOUR DECISION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION?\n\n   [GONZALEZ] IN MY OPINION, TWO POSITIONS ON THE DIALOGUE AND THE\nNEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WERE MADE EVIDENT IN SAN JOSE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF\nALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND VIEW THE DIALOGUE\nAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TALKING, BUYING TIME, AND BUILDING A GOOD IMAGE\nFOR THEMSELVES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FMLN IS WORKING FOR A REAL\nNEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  THE FMLN HAS OPENED A BROADER DEBATE, A DEBATE\nTHAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL\nPARTIES, THE SOCIAL FORCES, THE CHURCH, ALL THE SECTORS. WE HAVE\nINITIATED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  AS WE SEE IT, THE GOAL IS PART OF A\nWHOLE, IT IS NOT EVERYTHING.  THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THE\nPARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL FORCES IS IMPORTANT ALSO.\n\n   IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN ACTIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF\nEL SALVADOR.  THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON WORKERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS DIED\nAND 31 WERE INJURED.  THE FMLN CANNOT IGNORE THIS FACT.  THIS IS PART\nOF THE PROCESS.  WE HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH CONTACT\nWITH OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION, AND WE WILL\nDISCUSS THIS PROCESS WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE SOCIAL FORCES.\nWHAT WE WANT IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  WE ARE NOT\nTRYING TO ENHANCE OUR IMAGE; OUR PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH.\n\n   IN SAN JOSE WE MADE A SOLUTION PROPOSAL THAT ENVISAGES DEMOCRACY,\nHUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PROCESS TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SALVADORAN\nCONFLICT.  ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO MEET\nIN WASHINGTON WITH OAS AND UN REPRESENTATIVES.  ALSO ON MONDAY IN SAN\nJOSE, COSTA RICA, WE COULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE COSTA RICAN\nGOVERNMENT TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION.\n\n   WE WILL ANALYZE DEVELOPMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE\nCRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  IF ACTIONS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT CLOSE\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF CARACAS, THEN WE WILL ADOPT MEASURES.  WHAT WE\nHAVE DONE IS TO ANNOUNCE A SUSPENSION TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAKING\nPROGRESS TOWARD REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AS THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENTS\nESTABLISH.\n\n   [REPORTER] THEN WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CARACAS, COMMANDER?\n\n   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT\nDELEGATION GOING TO CARACAS IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE GOVERNMENT'S\n IMAGE, AT CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE MASSACRE COMMITTED\nAGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] NOW THAT YOU MENTION THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHAT DO YOU\nTHINK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE THAT\nCRISTIANI HAS ANNOUNCED?\n\n   [GONZALEZ] ONE OF THE POINTS OF OUR SAN JOSE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR\nCHANGING THE SALVADORAN LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS VITIATED AND IS IN\nTHE HANDS OF ONE SINGLE PARTY.  SO, IN THIS FRAMEWORK, CONDUCTING AN\nINVESTIGATION IS LIKE PUTTING THE CASE INSIDE A FORGOTTEN DRAWER.\nTHIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONSIGNOR ROMERO CASE, THE CASE OF THE\nREVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, AND THE CASES OF THOUSANDS OF\nWORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND WHOSE CASES HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN.\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CREATE A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE\nGRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING COMMITTED BY THE CRISTIANI\nGOVERNMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO FORM\nPART OF THIS COMMISSION SHOULD NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO PLAYING A PART\nIN THE EFFORT TO HIDE WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND ALL THIS.  WHAT THE\nCRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WANTS IS TO DIVERT AWAY FROM EMILIO PONCE ALL THE\nACCUSATIONS AND CHARGES, AND PONCE IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED\nIN THIS KIND OF ATTACK.  THE STATE POLICY OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT\nIS REPRESSION, AND THIS STATE POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE\nCRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI, AND THE HIGH COMMAND, AND THEY ARE\nDOING IT THROUGH THE REPRESSIVE BODIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY\nFUNCTION AS CIVILIANS, AS DEATH SQUADS, OR IN UNIFORM.

HOWEVER, THE\nGOVERNMENT WAS NOT REALLY SEEKING THE PATH TOWARD A NEGOTIATION.  ON\nTHE CONTRARY, IT SOUGHT TO CONDUCT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE DIALOGUE\nACTIONS THAT WILL GIVE IT AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE FMLN, INCLUDING\nTERRORIST ATTACKS LIKE THIS ONE.  THE OPERATION AGAINST THE FENASTRAS\nLEADERSHIP IS PART OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND SO IS THE\nWAVE OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE MASS MOVEMENT FROM THE ONSET OF THIS\nGOVERNMENT.\n\n   THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED IN COSTA RICA INCLUDED MASS GROUPS AS PART\nOF THE ENEMY.  ALL THESE THINGS ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICY.  WE\nCANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO HIDE THIS POLICY BEHIND THE DIALOGUE,\nAS THIS POLICY ALLOWS ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE AT FENASTRAS TO GO\nUNPUNISHED AND DO NOT LEAD TO A TRUE SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.  THAT\nIS WHY THE FMLN SUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN CARACAS, BUT HAS NOT\nSUSPENDED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  IN FACT, THE FMLN HAS\nUNDERTAKEN BIDS TO CONDUCT A MEDIATION SO THAT THE ADEQUATE CONDITIONS\nFOR A DIALOGUE ARE CREATED AND ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE IN FENASTRAS DO\nNOT CONTINUE.  DEEP DOWN, WE FEEL THAT IN ORDER FOR THE DIALOGUE TO\nTURN INTO A NEGOTIATION THAT WILL END THE SALVADORAN\nCONFLICT...[CHANGES THOUGHT] THE PROGRESS OF THE MASS MOVEMENT IN EL\nSALVADOR WITH ALL THE EXISTING FORMS OF STRUGGLE IS WHAT WILL COMPEL\nTHE OTHER SIDE TO REALLY SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATIONS TABLE.\n\n   SO LONG AS THE OTHER SIDE FEELS THAT IT CAN DEFEAT THE PEOPLE, IT\nWILL NOT BE TRULY COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT.\nWHEN IT SEES THAT THE PEOPLE WILL DEFEAT IT, AND THAT IT IS FORCED TO\nNEGOTIATE, THEN A NEGOTIATION WILL TRULY TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   [REPORTER] COMMANDER MARIO LOPEZ, THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS, EVEN\nFOLLOWING THE FENASTRAS ATTACK, INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY DOES\nNOT SEEM TO CHANGE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND THREATS\nTO THE MASS MOVEMENT.  IN FACT, THE LUTHERAN CHURCH, OR RATHER ITS\nPASTOR LEARDO GOMEZ, HAS RECEIVED DEATH THREATS.  DO YOU THINK AN\nINTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES IS POSSIBLE?  DO YOU THINK THAT\nWITH THAT INTERNAL PURGE IT CAN BE POSSIBLE TO STOP THE EXTREME HUMAN\nRIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY?\n\n   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN HAS PROPOSED AN INTERNAL PURGE IN THE ARMED\nFORCES AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PROCESS OF DIALOGUE OR\nNEGOTIATIONS, MEANING THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES MUST GET RID OF\nTHE CORRUPT AND CRIMINAL ELEMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE CRUX OF THE MATTER IS\nTHE NEED TO PURGE THE ARMED FORCES.  THE FMLN HAS TOLD THEM: PURGE\nYOURSELVES.  HOWEVER, THAT IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.  ON ONE SIDE,\nTHE NEED TO HAVE A TRUE PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES BECOMES APPARENT,\nBECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CANNOT MAKE PROGRESS AND HAVE TRUE DEMOCRACY IN\nOUR COUNTRY.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE PROVING THE FMLN IS RIGHT.  ON\nTHE OTHER SIDE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS CONTROL THE\nMILITARY POWER AND HAVE INFLUENCE OVER THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL POWER.\n\n   THE PRESENCE OF LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE\nCAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL] IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION\nCAMERAS, FOLLOWING THE DIALOGUE SESSION IN COSTA RICA, WAS MEANT TO\nTELL THE PEOPLE: WE RULE AND CAN DO AS WE PLEASE.  THEN THE ATTACKS\nCAME.  I FEEL THAT THE NEED TO END THAT SITUATION IS EVIDENT TO ALL,\nAS WELL AS HOW RIGHT THE FMLN STAND IS.  I NOW WANT TO REITERATE THAT\nWE CANNOT ACHIEVE THAT GOAL UNLESS WE FORCE THE ARMED FORCES AND THE\nGOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT THAT PURGE.  BY FORCING THEM, I MEAN THAT THE\nPEOPLE'S FORCE MUST TELL THEM TO DO THAT IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE.  THE\nDEMAND THAT COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF\nSTAFF] LEAVE, AS HE IS ONE OF THE CHIEF CULPRITS OF THE\nABOVE-MENTIONED POLICY, WILL GROW STRONGER.

HE SAID THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE\nWILL DEPEND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIS VISIT TO\nOUR COUNTRY?\n\n   [SALVATIERRA] IT IS BASICALLY AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S PRESTIGE\nAND IMAGE, AS THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY NEED A POTABLE IMAGE, AN IMAGE\nTHAT PORTRAYS LEGITIMACY, AND AN IMAGE OF MODERATION THAT WILL NOT\nISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT INTERNATIONALLY. THE FENASTRAS INCIDENT\nUNDOUBTEDLY UNMASKED CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, ARONSON'S\nVISIT IS AIMED AT SAVING CRISTIANI'S IMAGE AND SUPPORTING CRISTIANI'S\nINITIATIVE OF CREATING A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THOSE INCIDENTS, IN\nORDER TO FOSTER HOPES AND CREDIBILITY AMONG SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE\nGOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN CLARIFYING THE INCIDENTS. THAT WAS ARONSON'S\nINTENTION.\n\n   AS A MATTER OF FACT, CRISTIANI'S IMAGE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AID\nITSELF. ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN\nTHE DEBATES AT THE U.S. CONGRESS, WHERE THE AID IS APPROVED.\nTHEREFORE, THAT AID WOULD BE ENDANGERED IF THE DEBATES ON VIOLATIONS\nOF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR ARE INTENSIFIED. IT COULD HAVE AN\nEFFECT ON THAT. SO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO SAVE IS THE AID TO\nCONTINUE SUPPORTING THE WAR.\n\n   IN THAT REGARD, WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF\nLOW INTENSITY WARFARE, THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY\nPLAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT WILL NOT APPEAR TO\nBE IN THE EXTREME RIGHT; A GOVERNMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE MORE IN THE\nCENTER THAN IN THE EXTREME RIGHT, IN ORDER TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS\nWITHIN SOME GROUPS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY, AND ALSO AT\nTHE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE REBELS MILITARILY\nAND THROUGH REPRESSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE\nIMAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE FMLN'S POLITICAL-DIPLOMATIC\nCOMMISSION.

WHAT ARE THE\nPOSSIBILITIES FOR RESTORING THE TALKS AND CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE -\nNEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT?\n\n   [SALVATIERRA] THE FMLN IS INTERESTED IN A REAL DIALOGUE, A DIALOGUE\nTHAT WILL LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT; IN OTHER\nWORDS, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL LEAD TO NEGOTIATIONS.  WE DIFFER WITH\nCRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT ON THIS.  FROM THE BEGINNING, ARENA\n[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] HAS EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO\nPARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE, BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE.
