THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE OVER THE MILDNESS\nWITH WHICH THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE REACTED TO\nTHE U.S. AGGRESSION AGAINST PANAMA.

THE SECOND\nIMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARY\nORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE\nUNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BE\nABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL.\n\n   THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.  ACCORDING TO THE\nTIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DID\nEXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM.\n\n   NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE.\nRATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.  THEREFORE,\nSINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS A\nREPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT.  WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THE\nTIAR.  THIS MUST BE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE\nCALLED A SPECIAL SESSION.\n\n   [REPORTER] SEVERAL SECTORS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW\nTHE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AS A HASTY DECISION.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\n\n   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT THOSE MUST BE SECTORS COMMITTED TO THE\nINVASION.  THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITED\nSTATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDE\nWHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT.\n\n   AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE AND\nBLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION.\nTHERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIAN\nTERRITORY.  THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW\nGOVERNMENT.  THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG AS\nTHIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOT\nSTAY IN THAT COUNTRY.  THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; IT\nREPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE.\n\n   AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILL\nKEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE.  AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT\nWITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN AND\nPERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER.\n\n   [REPORTER] DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAIN\nRELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN'T IT JEOPARDIZE THE\nIMF LOAN?\n\n   [GARCIA] NOT AT ALL.  THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nTHE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONAL\nPOLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC AND\nMILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE.\n\n   BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.  AS FOR\nPANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN\nACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WHEN ELECTIONS TOOK\nPLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATES\nDECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGE\nFRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACE\nNICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER.  THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITO\nWERE THE AMERICANS.  ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA.\n\n   IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HIS\nPLACE.  THE AMERICANS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DEL VALLE AS PRESIDENT.\nTHEREFORE, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NORIEGA'S ACCOMPLICE IN\nDEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WE DENOUNCED THIS.  NORIEGA IS A\nCREATION OF THE UNITED STATES.  IT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN SAID THAT\nNORIEGA WORKED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THE U.S.  CENTRAL\nINTELLIGENCE AGENCY, WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS ONCE CHIEF.\n\n   THEREFORE, NOW THAT THE MAID IS ANSWERING BACK, MAKING CLAIMS TO\nTHE PANAMA CANAL AND WANTING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM THE UNITED\nSTATES, THE UNITED STATES SUDDENLY DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS A DRUG\nTRAFFICKER AND THAT SHE DOES NOT SERVE ITS INTERESTS, SO THEY SEND\n30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS TO PANAMA.  THIS IS AN ABUSE.  IT IS A VIOLATION\nOF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANOTHER STATE.\n\n   NO HONORABLE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY SHOULD TOLERATE THIS INVASION\nWITHOUT ACTIVELY AND OPENLY CONDEMNING IT.  ONE WAY TO CONDEMN IT AND\nEXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OF IT IS TO SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE TROOPS\nINVADING LATIN AMERICA REMAIN, WE DO NOT NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR\nAMBASSADOR THERE.

THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]\nLEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE\nONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE\nCLEARED-UP.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION [ARMED\nFORCES] THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS\nMEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR\nPOLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE\nARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT\nOUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE\nPASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN\nON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD\nTO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE\nHAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. [END RECORDING]\n\n   D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN\nCLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE\nCONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING\nFACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF\nTHE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS\nIS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOT\nBELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY\nAFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID\nARISE [WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED], THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  I\nKNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE\nDISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.\nFOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE\nNEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY\nCAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM\nOF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE\nTHINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE\nTHEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. [END RECORDING]\n\n   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\nPRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS\nAGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE\nMILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN\nTHE PARTY.  D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D'AUBUISSON] NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVER\nBEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE\nARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE\nMAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.

THESE AGREEMENTS ARE A VICTORY FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY,\nPROGRESSIVE, INDEPENDENT, AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE REGION, AND AS\nSUCH, WE STRONGLY PRAISE THEM.\n\n   2. THESE AGREEMENTS SEAL THE POLITICAL DEATH OF THE CONTRAS AND\nDECLARE TO THE WORLD THE FAILURE OF THE POLICY OF AGGRESSION THAT THE\nREAGAN ADMINISTRATION INITIATED AND CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF\nCENTRAL AMERICA.\n\n   3. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES WERE PREPARED TO PUT\nFORWARD A THEORY OF PARALLELS, ALL OF THEIR ALLEGED EVIDENCE WAS\nDERIDED AND DISCARDED.\n\n   4. CRISTIANI HAS SIGNED OFF ON THE CONTRAS' DEATH AND ACKNOWLEDGED\nBEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE FMLN IS A FORCE WITH WHICH IT MUST\nTALK AND NEGOTIATE.  HE WENT TO TELA WITH A DIALOGUE PLAN TO COVER UP\nTHE WAR, BUT HE WAS FORCED, UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, TO NEGOTIATE FOR\nPEACE WITH THE FMLN.  CRISTIANI'S DIALOGUE COMMISSION, IN FACT, HAS\nBEEN DEMOBILIZED.\n\n   5. CRISTIANI WAS FORCED TO SIGN A PLEDGE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION WHEN\nHIS PLANS WAS TO FASCISTIZE EL SALVADOR.\n\n   6. THE FMLN REAFFIRMS ITS RESOLVE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE\nEFFORTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOPRIC, AND\nOTHER SOCIAL FORCES TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE\nGOVERNMENT.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTRAS WERE A MERCENARY FORCE\nMAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ATTACKED NICARAGUA FROM\nHONDURAS, AND WHICH SHOULD AND COULD BE DEMOBILIZED.  IT IS CLEAR THAT\nTHE FMLN IS A NATIONAL FORCE THAT HAS REASONS FOR BEING AT WAR, AND\nWITH WHICH PEACE MUST BE NEGOTIATED.  NO ONE CAN DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN\nBECAUSE IT IS WITHIN THE COUNTRY AND IS A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL FORCE.\n\n   THE FMLN CALLS ON ALL FELLOW PATRIOTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN\nHONDURAS, NICARAGUA, COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD\nTO RETURN TO THE FATHERLAND.  THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THE TELA\nAGREEMENTS.  WE ASK ALL SALVADORANS TO DEMAND OF CRISTIANI THAT,\nWITHOUT FURTHER STRATAGEMS, HE CARRY OUT A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION;\nFULFILL HIS PLEDGE TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY; STOP THE REPRESSION,\nKIDNAPPING, AND TORTURE; RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; GUARANTEE\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; RESPECT REFORM; AND ABOLISH THE ECONOMIC\nMEASURES THAT ARE DEEPENING THE WAR.\n\n   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND \n\n   [DATED] 7 AUGUST 1989", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST1-MUC3-0021", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 15 MAR 89 (AFP) -- [REPORT] [ARTURO GUDINO]\n[EXCERPTS] SEVERAL HUNDRED ACTIVISTS OF THE RADICAL BREAD, LAND, WORK,\nAND FREEDOM MOVEMENT (MPTTL) MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN\nSALVADOR ON TUESDAY, OPENLY DEFYING THE GOVERNMENT AND CONDEMNING \"THE\nELECTION FARCE\" OF 19 MARCH.\n\n   PEASANTS, WHOSE HARDENED FACES AND BODIES REVEAL THE ENDURANCE OF\nLONG WORK DAYS, PARTICIPATED IN THE MARCH ALONG WITH WOMEN, WHO IN\nMANY CASES WERE CARRYING THEIR BABIES WHO NEVER KNEW THEIR FATHERS\nBECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE MURDERED BY SECURITY\nFORCES OR DEATH SQUADS, ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY TOLD AFP.\n\n   YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES MARCHED ALONG WITH THEM SHOUTING SLOGANS\nAND WITH THEIR FACES COVERED WITH RED HANDKERCHIEFS.

A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID:\n\"NOT AT ALL,\" \"WE WILL NOT PLACE (THE TWO) ON A PAR.\"  A STATE\nDEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE\nTO PROVIDE \"APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\" TO UNITA IN THE\nFUTURE.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST1-MUC3-0029", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   NO CITY (PERU), 16 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] AS A LATIN\nAMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THE\nSTATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED\nIN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FOR\nPRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM.\nTHAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTER\nFROM ONLY ONE SIDE.  OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVER\nIS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLE\nFOR THEM.  THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY.  AS\nPRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGE\nREGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHO\nMUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES.\n\n   WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHED\nTHESE CONCLUSIONS.  WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEEN\nHANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOS\nGALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN\nOFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEN\nEXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE.  THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THE\nWORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF\nAIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS TO COLOMBIA.  AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLY\nHELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIAN\nGOVERNMENT, WERE SENT.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSE\nHELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU.\n\n   I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORT\nPRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY.  IF HE HAS THAT MUCH\nCONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF\nWHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO\nREPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATIN\nAMERICA.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITH\nPRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS.  THEN, AS\nPRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME.  BUT THE\nMEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTAL\nINTEREST IN THE FUTURE.\n\n   [CORRESPONDENT] WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEAR\nFUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC?\n\n   [GARCIA] YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM.\nCARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECT\nDEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT.  THOSE MONOPOLIES\nMIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS\nGROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE IT\nWAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIAL\nMILITARY REGIME.  IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITY\nOF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES,\nWHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY A\nMATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OF\nOUR SOCIAL LIFE.  I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREE\nPRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S.  PRESIDENT KNOW OUR\nVIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM.\n\n   [CORRESPONDENT] WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT?\n\n   [GARCIA] I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE.  THE IDEA EMERGED\nIN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITH\nPRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.\n\n   [CORRESPONDENT] A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THIS\nMONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT?\n\n   [GARCIA] NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS.\nFOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP\nABROAD.  I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH\nPRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY\n1990.\n\n   [CORRESPONDENT] CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEEN\nSAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERU\nFROM THE IMF.  WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSION\nMEAN?\n\n   [GARCIA] WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BE\nEXPELLED FROM THE IMF.  SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM\nREGARDING THE MATTER.  WHAT IS THE IMF?  IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR\nBANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH\nBALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR\nFOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS.  WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100\nMILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR\nIMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS.  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO\nFACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  AN IMF\nCREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT\nPROGRAM.  ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTION\nSO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBT\nOBLIGATIONS.

RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS TO OUR PEOPLE ON\nTHE FIGHTING THAT IS UNDER WAY IN SAN SALVADOR.  WE ARE GOING TO GIVE\nYOU MILITARY INFORMATION FROM THE METROPOLITAN WAR FRONT, AS FOLLOWS:\n\n   THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION ARMORED VEHICLES\nIN CUSCATANCINGO.  AT 0700, THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMBUSH IN WHICH SIX\nARMORED VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED.  THE AMBUSH WAS STAGED AGAINST\nATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS IN CUSCATANCINGO WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO\nREINFORCE ENEMY POSITIONS UNDER ATTACK IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE\nCAPITAL.  OUR FORCES USED ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND SMALL ARMS FIRE, AS\nWELL AS EXPLOSIVES, TO AMBUSH THIS CONVOY, DESTROYING SIX ARMORED\nVEHICLES.\n\n   IN ADDITION, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION [FMLN] FIGHTERS\nATTACKED BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  THE BELLOSO\nBATTALION CALLED FOR AIR SUPPORT, WHICH IT RECEIVED, BUT THIS HAS\nRESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BECAUSE THE HELICOPTERS USED HAVE\nBEEN BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AYUTUXTEPEQUE\nAREA.  THE DESPERATE AIR SUPPORT HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN\nVICTIMS.\n\n   MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES BEGAN ATTACKING ENEMY POSITIONS IN LOS\nSANTOS, BOSQUES DEL RIO, AND UNICENTRO, IN SOYAPANGO.\n\n   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT BARRICADES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BUILT IN\nTHE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR'S NORTHERN AND\nSOUTHERN SECTORS.  THESE ARE BARRICADES BUILT BY YOUTHS, STUDENTS,\nWORKERS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO HELP\nWITH FOOD AND INFORMATION AND WHO, WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, ARE BUILDING\nBARRICADES AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF THE VANGUARD:  THE FMLN.\n\n   WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT THE FIGHTING WHICH\nHAD DECREASED IN THE UNIVERSITY AREA RESUMED AT 0600 THIS MORNING.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "TST1-MUC3-0041", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 20 DEC 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]\n[TEXT] FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA ISLAND, THE WORLD\nDISCARDED ANY FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF A U.S.  ARMED OPERATION AGAINST\nANOTHER NATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, DESPITE THE DETERIORATION OF\nITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT.  IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE U.S.  WOULD CONFINE ITS\nPARTICIPATION TO SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING MOVEMENTS AIMED AT OUSTING\nGOVERNMENTS OR, AS IN THE CASE OF NICARAGUA, OF SUPPORTING REBEL\nFORCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET BY THE WHITE HOUSE.\n\n   THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN PANAMA HAVE\nSURPRISED THE WORLD BECAUSE, DESPITE GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S\nCHALLENGING ATTITUDE, NO ONE THOUGHT THE U.S. WOULD INVADE PANAMA.\nNORIEGA WAS CERTAIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT DO SO, AND SUPPOSED\nTHAT U.S. ATTITUDES AGAINST HIM WOULD CONSIST OF SPONSORING REBELLION,\nSUCH AS THE RECENT 3-OCTOBER ATTEMPT, WHEN THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT\nENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES TO REBEL AGAINST\nTHEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  NORIEGA NEVER THOUGHT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\nWOULD EVER CONDUCT A MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST PANAMA, ALTHOUGH THERE\nWERE U.S. TROOPS BASED ON THE CANAL ZONE.  HE CONTINUED UNDER THIS\nIMPRESSION BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THESE TROOPS CHANGED FROM THEIR\nROLE OF SURVEILLANCE, NOT EVEN WHEN WASHINGTON PROMOTED THE REBELLION\nOF SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE PANAMANIAN FORCES.\n\n   THIS EXCESSIVE SECURITY DISTRACTED NORIEGA AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO\nCHALLENGE THE U.S. POLICIES.  NORIEGA DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S.\nTHREATS AND HE ADOPTED AN OMNIPOTENT STANCE, LIKE HIS RECENT DECISION\nTO APPOINT HIMSELF THE SUPREME LEADER OF PANAMA.  NORIEGA BELIEVED\nTHAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION IN HIS\nCOUNTRY, AND THAT THE U.S. DECISION TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION\nCURRENTLY IN EXILE WOULD PRODUCE MOVEMENTS AGAINST HIS REGIME, OR THAT\nA COMMANDO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THIS BELIEF,\nHE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND EQUIPPED MANY\nCIVILIANS WHO SUPPORTED HIM WITH WEAPONS TO BE READY TO DISMANTLE\nMOVEMENTS THAT TRIED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT.\n\n   AS THE CLOCKS STRUCK MIDNIGHT IN PANAMA, THE U.S. FORCES BEGAN AN\nOPERATION AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCE BARRACKS.  THE TROOPS\nALREADY BASED IN PANAMA, AND THOSE FLOWN IN FROM BASES IN CALIFORNIA\nAND IN OTHER CITIES NEAR PANAMA, STARTED A MASSIVE ATTACK TO OUST GEN\nNORIEGA.\n\n   THE INVASION, WHICH SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SOME AND TO OTHERS [WORDS\nINDISTINCT], WERE MAINLY CONDUCTED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN\nDECLARED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY\nTHE U.S. COURTS.\n\n   EARLY THIS MORNING, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT\nTHE OPERATION WAS AIMED AT CAPTURING NORIEGA AND TAKING HIM TO THE\nUNITED STATES TO BE TRIED FOR THE CRIMES ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE U.S.\nCOURTS, AT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TREATIES ON THE PANAMA CANAL,\nAND AT RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FARCICAL\nMAY-L989 ELECTIONS.\n\n   THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN PANAMA,\nWHICH IS FILLING THE WORLD WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE DANGER HOVERING\nOVER THE CONTINENT AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION HAS\nGONE BEYOND THE LOGIC OF THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA.\n\n   INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DID, HOWEVER, GUESS THAT SOMETHING WAS\nABOUT TO OCCUR WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID RECENTLY THAT WHILE THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT COULD REACH AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA, WITH NORIEGA IT WAS\nIMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD TO\nDO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VEILED DANGER THAT THREATENED THE AMERICAN\nCONTINENT.\n\n   TODAY, PANAMA HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD.  THE CAPITAL AND OTHER\nCITIES ARE BATTLEFIELDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FIGHTING\nTHE U.S. UNITS IN GROUND, AIR, AND MARITIME OPERATIONS THAT SEEK TO\nOUST MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.\n\n   THE U.S. ACTION IS FOCUSSING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION ON WASHINGTON'S\nDECISION.  MANY NATIONS WILL PROTEST AND REJECT THE U.S. INVASION\nWHICH WAS DISGUISED BY A SERIES OF PEACE-SEEKING ACTIONS.\n\n   FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE, THE GHOST OF WAR IS HAUNTING OUR\nCONTINENT.  WE MUST PONDER ON THE NEED TO KEEP HONDURAS ON THE\nDEMOCRATIC PATH, AND TO AVOID THE ANARCHY THAT DESTROYS NATIONS AND\nDECIMATES PEOPLES.  THE EVENTS THAT HAVE KEPT THE WORLD IN VIGIL SINCE\nMIDNIGHT WILL CONTINUE FOR HOURS, DAYS, OR MAYBE WEEKS BECAUSE, SO\nFAR, THE NEWS IS VERY CONFUSING AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS ARE DYING ON THE\nSTREETS OF THE PANAMANIAN TOWNS.

I, WHO OWE\nEVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS AS\nMONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN IN\nTHE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF\nTHEM, OF COURSE.  THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM.\n\n   I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUT\nTHE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES.  I SIMPLY\nDEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOT\nCONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A\nSINGLE PERSON.  I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE\nINSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH.  I ONLY HAVE RESPECT AND\nLOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATION\nTO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOME\nNEFARIOUS MEMBERS.  I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD,\nWHO FIGHT EVERY DAY.  OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVE\nPROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, AS\nIF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THE\nINSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE.  QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  MY\nCRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATION\nAND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION.

IT HAS BEEN\nSAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THE\nRESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THE\nINVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS' CASE.  DO YOU THINK THERE HAS\nBEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE\nADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION?\n\n   [OCHOA] I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF I\nCOULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  A REDUCTION\nIN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS\nBECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED.  I THINK IT IS\nRIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT\nOF MY REMARKS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED\nFORCES' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED.\nMY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF\nOPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES' CONSTITUTIONAL\nMISSION.  HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE\nPROTECTED.\n\n   I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF\nTO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT HAS\nENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SAN\nSEBASTIAN PEOPLE.  I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES.\nONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY.  THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERY\nWAR.  I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE\nCOMMANDER IN CABANAS.  I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THE\nPOPULATION TO HELP THEM.  I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THE\nARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MY\nMEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF\nTHE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES.  TO POINT THESE THINGS OUT\nIS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSE\nI LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS.

THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN IS\nNOW UNDER WAY.  TEN CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF LIMA.  WE MUST\nPARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE US\nFORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR\nFATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTS\nECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEED\nFOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES.\n\n   WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL\nPOLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THE\nMOUNTAIN RANGE.  THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS.\nHOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGH\nTHE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES.\n\n   IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGAL\nPUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED.\nSTIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES.\n\n   THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE,\nDRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY I\nPROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRY\nTERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECT\nBECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. I\nWOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND\nINSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN\nCONGRESS.\n\n   BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UP\nANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.\nTHIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU'S\nDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THE\nBATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARY\nCOURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD\nIMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THE\nFACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKED\nFOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES.\nSO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, AS\nPRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUT\nDELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS.\n\n   FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF\nPERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT\nOF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS AND\nTHEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE.\n\n   THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAY\nTHAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALF\nTRUE.  ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY,\nPOLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY\nJURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT\nAPPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235,\nWHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OF\nBETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR.\n\n   NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOT\nWANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHO\nAVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OF\nJUSTICE.  THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY\nALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSE\nTERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEY\nCOMMIT CRIMES.\n\n   MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARY\nSERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO,\nAFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2\nYEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THE\nCOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.\n\n   THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THE\nCOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANS\nWHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIR\nMILITARY OBLIGATIONS.

THE AGGGRESSIVE SEARCH FOR NEW MARKETS DOES NOT\nRESPECT OCEANS, JUST AS IT HAS NOT RESPECTED BORDERS.  ANYWHERE THERE\nARE CONSUMERS, THERE WILL BE SUPPLIERS.  IN FACT, COCAINE IS BUT ONE\nOF THE PERNICIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CRISIS OF DRUG ABUSE, WHICH IS\nMUCH BROADER.  WE MUST NOT DELUDE OURSELVES.  THIS SCOURGE AFFECTS US\nALL.\n\n   ACTING IN SOLIDARITY, AS A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, WE MUST FOLLOW\nTHIS PLAN OF ACTION:\n\n   FIRST, IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CURB THE DEMAND FOR\nILLEGAL DRUGS.  DRUG ABUSE IS THE FUEL THAT PROPELS NARCOTERRORISM.\nTODAY IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO LATIN AMERICAN\nDEMOCRACIES.  COCAINE USERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE KILLING OF MY\nPEOPLE BY THE CRIMINAL INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION.\nWITHOUT ANY DOUBT, IN ANY OF THE DISTINGUISHED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nOF THIS CITY, A HABITUAL COCAINE USER MAY REGARD MY ASSERTION AS AN\nEXAGGERATION.

[APPLAUSE]\n\n   NO WEAPON OR TACTIC USED IN THIS STRUGGLE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH\nIF IT IS NOT COMBINED WITH RESOLUTE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND.  THE\nILLEGAL PROFITS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE.  I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL DEFEAT\nTHE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN COLOMBIA, BUT SOMEONE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY,\nSOMEWHERE, WILL TAKE OVER THIS BUSINESS AS LONG AS IT REMAINS SO\nPROFITABLE.  THIS HAPPENED WITH MARIJUANA.  WHEN IT BECAME TOO COSTLY\nFOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE OF THE\nEFFECTIVENESS OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, THE TRADERS IN VICE MOVED THEIR\nPLANTATIONS TO CALIFORNIA, TO HAWAII, AND TO MANY OTHER REGIONS.  THE\nONLY LAW THE DRUG RUNNERS DO NOT VIOLATE IS THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND\nDEMAND.

ALL THE DEMOCRATS OF THE AMERICAS WHO\nSEE IN YOU, MR. PRESIDENT PEREZ, A GREAT FIGHTER, ARE NOW CELEBRATING\nA POSITIVE WAVE OF LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE IN URUGUAY,\nCHILE, BRAZIL, COSTA RICA, AND NICARAGUA.  VERY SHORTLY COLOMBIA AND\nLATER PERU WILL HOLD ELECTIONS.  PANAMA, IN TURN, HAS CALLED FOR\nPOPULAR CONSULTATION IN THE FORM OF A REFERENDUM SO THAT THE PEOPLE\nWILL DECIDE ON IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.\n\n   THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, DEMOCRACY IS THE PATH AND THAT IS WHY IT\nWILL BE THE ADEQUATE MEANS FOR STRENGTHENING THE OAS AS A REGIONAL\nORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TRENDS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN A\nCOMMON OBJECTIVE OF SEARCHING FOR PEACE, FREEDOM, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE\nMAY AND SHOULD BE EXPRESSED AND CONSULTED ON.  THERE, THE MEMBERS WILL\nBE ABLE TO DISCUSS TOPICS THAT AFFECT US IN A DIRECT MANNER, SUCH AS\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE, FOREIGN DEBT, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION, AS WELL\nAS HOW TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ACTION WITH VARIOUS INTERLOCUTORS,\nSUCH AS THE CASE OF CANADA, THE ENTRY IF WHICH INTO THE OAS WE WARMLY\nWELCOME.\n\n   THEREFORE, LET US CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS MEETING WHICH WE DO\nNOT HESITATE IN TERMING HISTORIC.  THE DOCUMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF HOW\nMUCH WE HAVE ADVANCED IN SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF\nENERGY, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND BORDER TRANSIT; IN JOINT\nPROGRAMS IN CITY PLANNING SUCH AS THE CUCUTA-VILLA EL ROSARIO-SAN\nANTONIO-URENA; IN THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS, AND\nIN INDIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, CUSTOMS, AND EDUCATION.  ALL OF THESE ARE\nTOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE\nTEAMS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE.\n\n   THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST AND\nDEMOCRATIC PROJECT.  THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVE\nNATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARD\nWORKING PEOPLE.  THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HE\nEXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION,\nAND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES AND\nCONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS.  OUR COMMISSIONS HAVE\nSUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATER\nBASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADY\nBEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS.\n\n   COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, AND\nUNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR.\nTHE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY AND\nTELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUS\nALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGES\nTHAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZA\nAIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THE\nAGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGING\nFROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERS\nTO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS.\n\n   THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONAL\nCONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL,\nIT POINTS TO PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR\nCONSUMPTION.  IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THE\nPEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHING\nOR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED.\n\n   I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAY\nIS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICAN\nINTEGRATION.  BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIR\nRULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAY\nCONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENT\nIN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR,\nBOLIVAR.\n\n   MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TO\nWORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO.

THIS, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,\nHAS BEEN THE HARSHEST BLOW FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\nREJECTED AND SPURNED THEM WHEN THEY TRIED TO EXPOSE THE PEOPLE TO SO\nMUCH DANGER AND HARM.\n\n   IT WAS ALSO SATISFACTORY TO HEAR THE MANY STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT AND\nSOLIDARITY GIVEN BY SO MANY SALVADORANS. THEY HAVE TALKED THROUGH THE\nNATIONAL NETWORK AND EVERY OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, AND HAVE\nREJECTED AND SPURNED THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS.  FURTHERMORE,\nTHE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMY\nARE DRAFTING A PROGRAM TO HELP THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH HAVE BEEN\nAFFECTED BY THE FMLN'S ACTIONS--ONCE EVERYTHING IS CALM--AND TO\nRESUPPLY THE SUPERMARKETS AND STORES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE KNOW\nTHE PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS GETTING FOOD FOR THE LAST 2 AND 1/2 DAYS\nAND THE SUPPLIES SHOULD BE BROUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n\n   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE DO NOT WANT TO END THIS ADDRESS WITHOUT\nSTATING OUR DEEP GRATITUDE FOR YOUR--AND THE OTHER SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE'S--COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION. WE\nCAN ONLY FEEL PROUD ABOUT THE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT--NOT FOR US ON A\nPERSONAL BASIS BUT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, THE RIGHTS THAT THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE DEMAND--AND FOR THE SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE ARMED\nFORCES, WHOSE MORALE IS HIGH AND WHO TAKE PRIDE IN THE PROFESSIONALISM\nWHICH THEY HAVE ACQUIRED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO COUNTER THE SITUATION\nIN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE.\n\n   WE KNOW THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED, AND NOW IT IS A MATTER OF TIME\nBEFORE THE ARMED FORCES MANAGE TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND\nCOMPLETELY. ALSO, WE WANT TO STATE OUR DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE FRIENDLY\nCOUNTRIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY-- MOST OF ALL\nTHEIR SOLIDARITY WITH YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE-- BECAUSE THERE HAVE\nBEEN STATEMENTS WHICH, FRANKLY, HAVE FILLED US WITH EMOTION. FOR\nEXAMPLE, THOSE OF COSTA RICA, THE UNITED STAES, GUATEMALA, AND, IN\nSHORT, ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW IRRATIONAL\nTHE FMLN'S AGGRESSION IS. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND\nTHE REPUBLIC, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WILL,\nHAVE BEGUN A RATIONAL, PEACEFUL, AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ACHIEVE\nPEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   TO CONCLUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND\nUNDERSTANDING; BUT ALSO YOUR TRUST AND SERENITY. YOU CAN REST ASSURED\nTHAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS FROM\nTHE AGGRESSION WHICH THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE LAUNCHED. IT IS A\nDESPERATE ACTION AND, IN COUNTERING THE SITUATION, WE WILL BE MUCH\nCLOSER TO THE PEACE WE WANT SO MUCH.

DUARTE\nPROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL\nREFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE.\n\n   ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON'S\nGREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHER\nWORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY.  FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN.  IN\nREALITY 8 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE EL SALVADOR BECAME THE PLACE WHERE\nTHE REAGAN ERA'S MODELS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY, NEODICTATORSHIP, AND\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE WERE IMPLEMENTED.\n\n   WASHINGTON'S EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED.  THE\n19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S\nSALVADORAN STRATEGY.  TWO BASIC FACTORS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE U.S.\nFAILURE: FIRST, THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT DEMAGOGIC AND POLITICALLY\nUNSOUND REFORMS.  DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES'\nEXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION.  SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR,\nAND DEMOCRATIC FORCES' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WAS\nPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORE\nTHAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED.\n\n   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA IS\nTHE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC\nSECTORS.  WASHINGTON HAS RETURNED TO ITS STARTING POINT.  THE $3\nBILLION SPENT ON MILITARY ADVICE AND THE GENOCIDE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS\nOF SALVADORANS SERVED NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER.  IT IS ALL OVER.  ARENA\nREPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979.  IN\nOTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL,\nECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER.  THIS IS THE END, THE SAD END OF THE\nLOW-INTENSITY WAR EXERCISE.\n\n   U.S. GENERAL HARRY GORDON SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE SANTA FE GROUP,\nIN HIS BOOK ON THE MISTAKES THE UNITED STATES MADE IN VIETNAM, SAID\nTHE UNITED STATES' CONCEPT OF VICTORY AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN VIETNAM CAN\nNO LONGER BE TO ACHIEVE ITS ENEMY'S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, AS IN\nWORLD WAR II, BUT TO ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH IT\nSTARTED THE WAR.  THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED IN\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.  ARENA'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO\nTHE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OF\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.\n\n   FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WAS\nSQUANDERED.  FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, IT MEANS\nRAZED TOWNS, DEVASTATED ECONOMIES, AND THE DEATH OF 70,000 PEOPLE.\nTHE NEW U.S.  ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR EL\nSALVADOR.  WHAT IT HAS IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE ALLY, ARENA, AND A SOCIAL\nTIME BOMB ABOUT TO EXPLODE.\n\n   THE FMLN BELIEVES THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD STUDY THE NEW\nSITUATION IN EL SALVADOR AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN A REALISTIC AND\nPRAGMATIC MANNER.  THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR CONTINUES AND WILL CONTINUE\nAS LONG AS THERE IS NO CHANGE, NO REAL CHANGE, TO BENEFIT THE MASSES\nTHAT ARE STRUGGLING FOR THAT CHANGE.
