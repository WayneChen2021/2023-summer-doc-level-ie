I MAKE THIS REPORT 50 DAYS AFTER ASSUMING POWER.  AT THIS\nTIME I WANT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH; I WANT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT OUR\nSITUATION IS SO THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MUST DO IN THE\nFUTURE.  EVERY SALVADORAN MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND EFFORT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE A BIT MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE\nNOTHING OR VERY LITTLE.\n\n   THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, BUT WE MUST CONFRONT IT.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE\nA GOVERNMENT:  TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLY,\nBECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOING NOTHING WOULD MEAN A GREATER CRISIS FOR THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WOULD SINK OUR HOMELAND EVEN DEEPER IN THE BLACK ABYSS.\n\n   WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS; WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT GROUPS\nASKING THAT THE GOVERNMENT STATE WHAT IT IS PLANNING TO DO TO SOLVE THE\nPROBLEMS.  I WOULD LIKE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WE PREFER TO ACT CALMLY,\nSTUDY THE PROBLEM IN DEPTH, AND FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL TRULY SOLVE THE\nPROBLEM.  WE WOULD RATHER DO THIS THAN MAKE A RASH DECISION AND MAKE A\nMISTAKE.  THIS IS A TRULY DIFFICULT TASK.\n\n   BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE\nCOUNTRY, I WISH TO TOUCH ON THE THREE MAJOR AREAS THAT CREATE CONCERN AND\nTHAT I FEEL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.  \n\n   FIRST, LET US TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT WAS SWORN AND\nINDISCRIMINATE MURDERS.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE WE\nEXPRESSED OUR RESOLVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO\nTHE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN'S RESPONSE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN MORE VIOLENCE.\n\n   WE KNOW MANY GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY; THEY HAVE\nEVERY REASON TO COMPLAIN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO DO ALL THEY CAN\nTO PROTECT EVERYONE.  THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN THE PAST DAYS, ESPECIALLY\nIN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STRONGER.  THE ARMED\nFORCES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED MANY TIMES AND BY MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE\nGROUPS THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHARE THE FMLN'S IDEAS.  THEY CLAIM THAT\nTHE ARMED FORCES ACT IN A REPRESSIVE MANNER.  DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, LET US\nANALYZE WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES' DUTY IS TO CONTROL ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE\nLAW IS BROKEN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC\nORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES ONLY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ONLY\nCREATE VIOLENCE AND DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT TAKE\nACTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION.  WE HAVE AN ARMED FORCES TO\nDEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NEVER TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\nTHEREFORE, WHAT WE MUST DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REFUSING TO MAKE A\nCOMMITMENT AND WHO IS REFUSING TO SIT DOWN, IN A RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL\nMANNER, TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT THAT NO LONGER HAS A PLACE IN\nOUR HISTORY.  THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT WHAT WE, AS A GOVERNMENT,\nSAID ON 1 JUNE.  ON THAT DAY WE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND\nTALK.  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS A BIT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN\nMISUNDERSTANDINGS OVER OUR INTENTIONS IN THIS DIALOGUE.

AN\nINVESTIGATION IS WELL UNDER WAY INTO A CORPORATION WHICH HAS BEEN\nSMUGGLING MERCHANDISE INTO OUR COUNTRY.  THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS\nWILL SOON BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THIS FISCAL DEFICIT IN TWO WAYS --\nWE MUST EITHER INCREASE OUR REVENUE OR LOWER OUR DISBURSEMENTS.  THIS\nGOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN AUSTERITY MEASURES REGARDING THE LATTER.  THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN EXPENDITURES AT THE CURRENT\nLEVEL, BUT TO REDUCE THEM BY 15 PERCENT.  WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR\nGOVERNMENT'S AUSTERITY MEASURES MUST BE GENUINE AND SHOULD BE AIMED AT\nMAKING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF SCANT RESOURCES.  THIS IS WHY WE ARE ASKING\nPUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE MORE\nEFFICIENT, THE GOVERNMENT MUST PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE.  AFTER ALL, IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO PAY OUR SALARIES AND PROVIDE THE\nREVENUE THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE.\n\n   WE MUST SPEND OUR MONEY WISELY.  ALL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES MUST\nGUARD AGAINST CORRUPTION.  WE MUST TAKE PAINS TO SERVE THE POPULATION AND TO\nIMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING AND\nDESERVE.

THEY HAVE TO PAY\nTAXES.  WHEN TAXES ARE SQUANDERED, MISUSED, OR STOLEN, NO ONE WILL PAY THEM\nWILLINGLY.

WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE VERY\nSHORT TERM, WE HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS\nWITH AT LEAST THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES FOR THE PEOPLE.  WE\nHAVE ALLOTTED 17 MILLION COLONS FOR THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR THE\nPURCHASE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND FOR THE\nDISTRIBUTION OF THIS MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THAT THE POOR\nWILL RECEIVE THE EFFICIENT HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST\nPROVIDE.\n\n   THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS BEEN ASKED TO GIVE STUDENTS THE MATERIALS THEY\nNEED TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES.  A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOTTED\nFOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED BY THE SCHOOLS.  WHEN THE 1990 SCHOOL\nYEAR BEGINS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH\nTHE MATERIAL THEY NEED.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN, AS\nSOON AS POSSIBLE, REPAIRING THE STREETS AND ROADS.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\nCAN SEE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE.\n\n   FINALLY, LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  NEXT WEEK THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER WILL\nANNOUNCE THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE WILL HELP\nLOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY HOMES.  THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH A SUBSIDY PLAN\nENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME GROUPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY STEEP PAYMENTS AND\nWILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES.\n\n   WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED A SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN.  THIS PLAN WILL BE\nIMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND ITS FIRST PHASE WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE\nHIGHLY POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE PLAN WILL BENEFIT APPROXIMATELY 200\nCOMMUNITIES AND, AS OF NOW, I ASK THE MAYORS FOR THEIR HELP, BECAUSE WE WANT\nTO WORK WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  THIS FIRST PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT\nPROVIDING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES.  WE WILL PROVIDE\nTHEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER, WE WILL BUILD SEWER SYSTEMS, AND WE\nWILL HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  AMID THE CRISIS WE ARE\nEXPERIENCING, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE SMALL - SCALE\nBUSINESSMEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES.  WE WILL ORGANIZE A LOAN SYSTEM FOR SMALL\n- SIZE BUSINESSES FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.  I REPEAT:  THIS\nSOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER.  IN THE NEXT FEW\nWEEKS, WE WILL BEGIN TO SEEK THE COOPERATION OF THOSE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS\nTHAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN.\n\n   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE MUST ALL STRUGGLE FOR, AND THAT IS TO\nABOLISH UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE MUST STRUGGLE SO THAT EVERY SALVADORAN WILL HAVE\nTHE CHANCE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.  WE THEREFORE WISH TO LAUNCH AN\nOFFENSIVE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT\nVIOLENCE IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT\nFIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST COMMIT\nCRIMES TO SURVIVE OR THAT THEY MUST GET INVOLVED IN THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE\nSPONSORED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  THEREFORE, IN SEPTEMBER, WE WILL ALSO\nIMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT.  THIS PLAN HAS SOME\nSPECIFIC GOALS:  FIRST, TO PROVIDE A BASIC JOB FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE\nUNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED.  OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE 20,000 JOBS PER MONTH\nFOR THESE PEOPLE.  THIS PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AND WE\nWILL IMPLEMENT IT DURING THOSE MONTHS WHEN THERE IS USUALLY A DROP IN\nEMPLOYMENT.  I MUST STRESS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN\nDURING THE SOWING AND HARVEST SEASONS, BECAUSE DURING THOSE SEASONS THERE IS\nAN OVERABUNDANCE OF JOBS.

TODAY WE WILL\nDISCUSS THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM.  THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A\nBIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL\nARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES,\nCONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC.  HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN\nDEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT.\n\n   OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST?  WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION.  THIS\nREPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.  SINCE\nARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6\nBILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND\nTO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC.\n\n   OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN\nINTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS.\n\n   THIS IS NOT NEW.  THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN\nTHE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO.  WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME\nECONOMY MINISTER [MARCH 1976], THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION.\nWHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION.  THE\nMILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND\nINCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN.\nALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION.\nSO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION.\n\n   THIS IS NOT ALL.  WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD.  WE HAVE NOT\nEVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR.  WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN\nPAYMENTS.  THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR\nDEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW.  WE ARE NOT PAYING\nANYTHING.\n\n   FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS\nTHE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK.\n\n   ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING.  COUNTRIES ARE\nINTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST\nCATEGORIES.  OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED.  COMMERCIAL\nCREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY\nNEEDS.\n\n   WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL\nBANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED.  THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A\nCRISIS AT ANY MOMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS.\n\n   THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE\nEXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY\nCHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING.  BUT WE\nCANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS.  WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.\n\n   OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  OUR COUNTRY HAS NO\nPRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY.  NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR\nABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE\nNOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS.  EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF\nINTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT.  THERE HAVE\nBEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH.\n\n   WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE?  THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN\nHIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY.  HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT\nTHAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR.  HE USED\nWORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST.  \n\n   IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST\nOF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS\nOWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT.  WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF\nTHE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE,\nFLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS.\n\n   IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nPAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE.  WE WOULD BE\nISOLATED.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nOBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nINTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND\nPROGRESSING.  WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY.  THEREFORE\nTHERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING.  THE HONOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY IS AT STAKE.\n\n   WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY?  YOU KNOW\nTHAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY.  WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY,\nFISHING, MINING, ETC.  WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES.  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN\nARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.\nWE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS\nWITH OUR NEIGHBORS.\n\n   WHAT ARE WE MISSING?  WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE?\nWE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER.  WE LIVE\nIN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER.  SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL\nIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\n\n   I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE\nTAPPED.  FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE\nALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY.  JUST\nREMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY.  TO PROTECT THEMSELVES\nFROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO?  THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD\nOR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES.  WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE\nMATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO\nHAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD.  ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL,\nMEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY.  A\nPERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS\nMATTRESS.  MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST,\nDOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS\nNOR THE COUNTRY.\n\n   SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY,\nBECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND.  WE ARE NOT\nBANKRUPT.  WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING.  THE\nSECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT.  ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN\nBE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED.  NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED\nIT INTO A RESOLUTION.  INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN,\nDEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY.  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE\nWITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS\nWERE DEPOSITED.  NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM.  THIS WILL BE\nREINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC\nPOWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL\nSYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE\nBENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR.  ANYBODY WHO HAS\n$10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE\nGUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nDISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME.  THE BANK WILL\nLEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.\nNEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER\nWILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE\nTHEIR WITHDRAWAL.  THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE\nIS IMPOSSIBLE.  EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS.  IT HAS\nA CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT\nMOVES THE COUNTRY.  MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO\nTHIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO\nBRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE\nBECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION.\n\n   IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE\nCOUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT\nTHE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT.  ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON\nCONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP.  THIS\nIS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT.  TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE\nADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.  THESE\nMEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY\nRECOVER.  WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE\nLIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0313 (ITP, NYU)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "*", "INCIDENT: DATE": "*", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "*", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "*", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "*", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "*", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "*", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "*", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "*", "PHYS TGT: ID": "*", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "*", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "*", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: NAME": "*", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "*", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "*", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "*", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "*", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "*", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "*"}}, {"text": "   LIMA, 28 JUL 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIAN\nPRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [EXCERPTS] MR PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, GENTLEMEN\nMEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS:\n\n   TEN YEARS AGO, THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY PRESIDED OVER BY\nHAYA DE LA TORRE, CALLING UP ON LORD GOD FOR STRENGTH AND IN KEEPING WITH\nTHE POWERS VESTED IN US BY THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PEOPLE, APPROVED THE\nNATIONAL CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BEING COMES FIRST AND THAT\nALL HONORABLE PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSALLY VALID RIGHTS.  THUS WE DECIDED TO WORK\nFOR A FREE AND JUST SOCIETY AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE\nBASED ON POPULAR WILL AND ON THE FREE, PERIODIC CONSULTATION OF THIS WILL.\n\n   WE BET ON CIVILIZED COEXISTENCE AS A WAY OF LAUNCHING A PROCESS BASED ON\nSTABLE AND LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS, HOWEVER,\nWERE SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 1, WHICH RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL'S BASIC RIGHTS\nAND DUTIES FOR THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS PERSONALITY.\n\n   OUR CONSTITUTION WAS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE ACHIEVED AMONG VARIOUS AND\nSOMETIMES ANTAGONISTIC POLITICAL FORCES.  THUS, SOME OF ITS ECONOMIC\nARTICLES MAY SEEM VAGUE. HOWEVER, UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION ANY IDEOLOGY CAN\nGOVERN THE COUNTRY AND MAKE CHANGES IN ANY DIRECTION WHATSOEVER, AS LONG AS\nTHOSE FIRST CONDITIONS AGREED UPON BY CONSENSUS ARE RESPECTED. [PASSAGE\nOMITTED]\n\n   THIS IS THE LAST MESSAGE I WILL DELIVER TO CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT BEFORE I\nTURN THE PRESIDENCY OVER TO A CITIZEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE.\n\n   I CANNOT FAIL TO EXPAND ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE THIS YEAR, WHICH,\nHONESTLY SPEAKING ARE MUCH FEWER THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. I AM DELIVERING A\nSUMMARY OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING, AS ESTABLISH BY THE CONSTITUTION,\nFOR THE USE OF THE LEGISLATORS. IT IS A SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENTS.\n\n   IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO SAY THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE\nGOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE TO REAFFIRM THE SYSTEM OF\nDEMOCRATIC FREEDOM, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SYSTEM PERU HAS. WITH THIS\nFREEDOM, EVEN THE MOST EXTREME POSITIONS CAN EXIST. THE REACTIONARY\nPOSITIONS OF THE ULTRARIGHT AND RADICAL IDEOLOGIES CAN ALSO LIVE IN FREEDOM.\nVIOLENCE HAS LESS CHANCE OF DEVELOPING IN FREEDOM.  THE NATION HAS MORE\nLEGITIMATE MEANS TO ERADICATE VIOLENCE UNDER FREEDOM.\n\n   LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES DISAGREEMENTS,\nPOLITICAL PARTIES, LAWS, AND SKILLFUL LEGAL PROCEDURES CAN OBSTRUCT MANY\nTHINGS AND STOP DECISIONS. BUT THIS IS THE PRICE FOR A CIVILIZED LIFESTYLE.\nDEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE THE FORTHRIGHTNESS OF A DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY IS\nSLOWER, BUT DEMANDS MORE FIRMNESS, MORE CONVICTION, MORE PATIENCE. DEMOCRACY\nDEMANDS THE GRADUAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE; THIS TAKES A LONG TIME. I AM\nSAYING THIS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC\nCRISIS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1988, AND IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO MAKE HARSH CHANGES\nAT A TIME WHEN VIOLENCE HAS SEEMED TO INCREASE.\n\n   WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST THEIR COOL DEMANDING AN INTERRUPTION OF\nOUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CALLED FOR A SHORTER GOVERNMENT TERM. THEY ALSO SAID\nTHAT THE COUNTRY COULD DEFEAT THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS\nBY RESTRICTING FREEDOM AND ESTABLISHING AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE IMMATURE VOICES, DECEITFUL TEMPTATIONS. MANY OF\nTHOSE VOICES UNFORTUNATELY CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH. BY DOING\nTHIS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT YET READY TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY\nAND TO ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TENSIONS, EVEN AT THE WORSE TIMES,\nSHOULD BE HANDLED WITH SERENITY AND PATIENCE. A DICTATORSHIP THAT VIOLATES\nLEGAL PROCEDURES WILL ONLY HELP TO INCREASE VIOLENCE AND LEGITIMATE\nINSURGENCY, AND WOULD STIMULATE THE CREATION OF NEW SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. A\nDICTATORSHIP CANNOT SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED\nPOWER AND WOULD IMPOSE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD LEAD NOWHERE.\n\n   I AM REFERRING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE A CRUCIAL\nPERIOD. I CALL ON THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY\nBY REALIZING THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH MORE\nDEMOCRACY, WITH MORE FREEDOM, AND WITH MORE PARTICIPATION. TO HAVE\nDEMOCRACY, ONE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE.\n\n   THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. I AM COMMITTED TO MORE FREEDOM AND\nMORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH SOMETIMES WE DOUBT BECAUSE OF EXCESSES.\nBUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, BECAUSE WITHOUT FREEDOM\nOF EXPRESSION ABUSE WILL PREVAIL.

THROUGHOUT HISTORY,\nTHE NATIONAL ARMY HAS COMPLIED WITH THAT MANDATE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN AN\nEASY TASK, EVEN LESS SO DURING THE TIMES WE ARE LIVING.  VERY FEW\nNATIONS HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT SIMULTANEOUSLY SO MANY DIFFICULT\nCHALLENGES.  CONFRONTED BY A COMBINATION OF SOURCES OF DISRUPTION, THE\nARMED FORCES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR DETERMIANTION AND OPTIMISM, NOR HAVE\nTHEY STOPPED FOR 1 MINUTE TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF\nTRANQUILLITY FOR THE CITIZENS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE, HONOR,\nAND PROPERTY OF COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS THE VIOLENCE INCREASES, OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND COLOMBIA IS\nSTRENGTHENED.  THE PRICE OF COURAGE AND FIRMNESS HAS BEEN HIGH.  MANY\nSOLDIERS, OFFICERS, AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THEY\nARE THE HEROES OF DEMOCRACY.  ON THE OCCASION OF ARMY DAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF\nOF THE VAST NATIONAL MAJORITY AND CONVEY TO THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND\nFELLOW SOLDIERS OUR MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, APPRECIATION, AND HOPE.  THEIR\nEFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN IN VAIN.\n\n   THE BATTLE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND DEFEAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES.  THE\nDETERMINATION OF COLOMBIANS DOES NOT WEAKEN.  OUR ENEMIES ARE ALONE, AS\nNEVER BEFORE, AND THIS WE OWE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS BY OUR ARMED FORCES.\n\n   IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, I OFFERED THE COLOMBIANS A POLICY OF\nRECONCILIATION BASED ON DEFINED GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES.  THIS WAS\nTHE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE.  NOW, WHEN WE ARE\nHARVESTING THE RESULTS OF THAT STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT GIVE UP.  THE PEACE\nINITIATIVE HAS SHOWED THAT IT CAN OPERATE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE\nFRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT POLITICAL ACTION FOR NATIONAL\nRECONCILIATION.\n\n   SOME BELIEVE THAT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEAVE IT\nIDLE, AT THE MERCY OF VIOLENCE.  OTHERS ARGUE THAT PEACE CAN ONLY BE\nACHIEVED IF WE DISMANTLE OUR CAPABILITY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  WE DO NOT\nAGREE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONFIRMED THAT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE\nQUEST FOR PEACE ARE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE\nARMED FORCES, BUT THAT THIS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ADVANCING THE POLITICAL\nHANDLING OF VIOLENCE.\n\n   EFFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT SERVE THE COUNTRY ARE A\nDEFINITE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.\nTHAT IS WHY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A GREAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL\nEFFORT TO RETURN TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTIONS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ACTION.\n\n   THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IS A\nSUITABLE TIME TO PONDER OUR DUTY TO THE HOMELAND.  I AM NOT REFERRING TO\nDAILY CIVIC DUTIES, WHICH ARE PROPER TO ALL OF US COLOMBIANS, BUT TO\nSOMETHING MUCH DEEPER -- LOYALTY TO DEMOCRACY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS.\nDEMOCRACY'S BOUNDARIES ARE BROAD, BUT PRECISE.  WHEN VIOLENCE TO A CERTAIN\nEXTENT IS TOLERATED, MORE VIOLENCE IS CREATED, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST\nPEACE, AND CONFLICTS ARE AGGRAVATED.  THE ENTIRE SOCIETY HAS SUFFERED\nBECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENEMIES OF COLOMBIA.

TERRORISTS REALLY DO VIOLATE THEIR CONDITION AS\nARMED FORCES RESERVES WHEN THEY TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE\nARMED FORCES.\n\n   IT IS THEREFORE OUR PURPOSE TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY.  THE CONSTITUTION\nMUST BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF PERU, SINCE IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED IN\nFAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.  \n\n   I AM SURPRISED THAT ON THE ONE SIDE PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LITTLE ACTION\n TAKEN AGAINST TERRORISTS, WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A CONCRETE\nINITIATIVE LIKE THIS ONE TO PUNISH THEM.\n\n   THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RESUME THE DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE THE\nELECTION CAMPAIGNS MAKE US FORGET THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  ON\nTHE CONTRARY, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS WE MUST QUICKLY MAKE ALL\nTHE IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND APPROVE STRICT PUNISHMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO\nLIVE IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, PEACE, AND SAFETY.

THE\nCHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL\nPROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER.\n\n   THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY\nTHREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES.  THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS\nESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE.\n\n   2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS\nILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES.  THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE\nNAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS.\n\n   3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  HIS\nESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO.\n\n   4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE\nLAST MINUTE.  THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE.  HE MUST CHANGE\nROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT.\n\n   5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP.  \n\n   6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN.  HE WILL HAVE\nTO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST.  SUPPORTERS, PLEASE\nTAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\n\n   7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR\nCANDIDATE.  PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS.\n\n   8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING\nDEMONSTRATIONS.  SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS.\n\n   9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE\nCANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY.  ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW\nSUCH THINGS.\n\n   10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE\nTHEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM.  CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS\nAT UNUSUAL HOURS.\n\n   THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON.  ALL THESE MEASURES\nHAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE\nPOLICY OF TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENT PLANS BEFORE THEY ARE CARRIED OUT\nIS SOMETHING THAT HAS PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS.\n\n   OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE SUSPECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF SUPPORTING THE\nFMLN PLANS ARE ARRESTED AND TURNED OVER TO THE JUDGE ONCE THE EVIDENCE IS\nGATHERED.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.  UNFORTUNATELY MANY\nOF THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED ARE LATER RELEASED.  MANY OF THEM TURN OUT TO BE\nINNOCENT BECAUSE SUSPICIONS MAY TURN OUT TO BE FALSE AND THE JUDGE IS THERE\nTO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING COMMITTED.  HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nACTING WITHIN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK.\n\n   THERE ARE CASES SUCH AS MR MASARIEGO.  WHEN HE WAS RELEASED, IT WAS\nCONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM, AND WE HAVE HERE\nDOCUMENTS PROVING THAT.  HOWEVER, HE TOURED THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW OFF\nHIS BURNT KNEE AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN TORTURED HERE IN EL SALVADOR.  IT\nHAD BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS\nRELEASED.  THE LEFT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES\nABROAD.  HOWEVER, I DO NO BELIEVE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.\n\n   [KOBERG] MR PRESIDENT, AN ANALYST WHO MET WITH US A SHORT TIME AGO GAVE\nHIS OPINION ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE AND ITS RESULTS.  HE WAS NOT\nVERY OPTIMISTIC AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL POINTS THAT COULD BECOME\nOBSTACLES TO THE DIALOGUE.  ONE OF THEM WAS THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  HE SAID\nTHAT THE FMLN COULD NOT HOLD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE\nGOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THE ECONOMIC MEASURES IT WAS IMPLEMENTING.  WE HAVE\nLEARNED FROM THE FMLN COMMUNIQUES, WHICH ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP\nIMPLEMENTING THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS AND OTHER SERIES OF POINTS\nCONCERNING THE ECONOMIC MEASURES.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WITHIN THIS\nFRAMEWORK, WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATE OR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT\nUNDERSTAND BY NEGOTIATION?  COULD THERE BE POSSIBLE NEGOTIATION ON THE\nECONOMIC POLICY?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HERE IN OUR COUNTRY NO LONGER\nHAS THAT GENERIC MEANING GIVEN BY THE DICTIONARY.  THIS WORD HAS BEEN\nMANIPULATED BY LEFTIST FORCES IN THE SENSE THAT TO NEGOTIATE IS TO ACCEPT\nWHAT THE FMLN WANTS.  ACCORDING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS WHAT NEGOTIATING\nMEANS.  I BELIEVE THE WORD NEGOTIATION HAS A GENERIC MEANING.  A NEGOTIATION\nIS TO TRY TO FIND JOINT AGREEMENTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE\nHAVE BEEN PROPOSING.  WE HAVE SOUGHT AGREEMENTS ON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF\nPOINTS POSSIBLE.  LOGICALLY, NOT ALL POINTS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER\nSIDE AND WE BELIEVE THE FMLN IS MAKING A MISTAKE WHEN IT THINKS IT WILL\nNEGOTIATE ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR SOCIAL PLATFORM WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\nTHE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR PLANS FOR THE\nCOUNTRY WITH THE PEOPLE.  THAT IS DONE BY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND BY SHOWING\nTHEIR PROPOSALS TO THE PUBLIC.  IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR\nPROPOSALS ARE BEST, THEY WILL GET THE VOTES AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO\nIMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEIR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS.\n\n   IN THIS CASE, UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE; IT WAS OUR PARTY\nPLATFORM THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.  THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT\nTO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ASK OF THEM.\n\n   WE DO NOT THINK THE FMLN SHOULD OPPOSE THIS OFFERING.  THE FMLN REFUSES\nTO TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND KEEPS LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND SETTING\nCONDITIONS, SUCH AS DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECLARE ITSELF TEMPORARY\nBEFORE ANY TALKS ARE CONSIDERED.  THEY KNOW THEY ARE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE.\nTHEIR TRUE PURPOSE IS TO REFUSE TO TALK SERIOUSLY, WHICH THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE WANTS THEM TO DO.  LORENA, I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD CONFUSE THE\nVARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED.  HOLDING A DIALOGUE IS NOT EASY, AS POINTED OUT BY\nTHIS ANALYST, WHOSE NAME I DO NOT KNOW.  THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY TO\nRESOLVE.  THIS PROCESS COULD WELL LAST MANY MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS.  IT IS\nNECESSRY TO START NOW WITH A DIALOGUE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES BEGIN TO DISCUSS,\nNOT WHAT THEY CANNOT AGREE ON, BUT WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON.  WE SHOULD BEGIN BY\nTRYING TO ELIMINATE THE VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY.  IF THEY FIND\nTHEY CANNOT AGREE ON SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD\nALSO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE STANCE.  THE FMLN KEEPS SAYING THAT THERE ARE\nNO PROPER CONDITIONS FOR TALKING.
