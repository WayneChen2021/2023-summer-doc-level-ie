GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS\nTHE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT\nWITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE\nSALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN\nOF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL\nSALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.\n\n   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE\nAIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE\nDEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,\nTOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE\nGENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN\nEL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS\nAND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE\nIMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN\nEL SALVADOR.\n\n   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE\nOF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER\nEUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE\nWOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS\nMOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,\nMONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT\nMURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT\nWHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF\nGENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?\n\n   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE\nPAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT\nREBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED\nHAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.\n\n   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN\nACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE\nNEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES\nGENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO\nACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE\nTOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR\nSECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.\nBUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR\nDEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL\nOPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT\nSUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS\nNOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS\nIT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT\nTHEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:\nTO STOP THE FMLN.\n\n   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF\nTHE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG\nDEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS\nAND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING\nFOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN\nOF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER\nTHIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN\nDEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.\n\n   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL\nBEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S\nSCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS\nMACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE\nAPPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE\nOBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES\nOF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO\nLEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,\nCOMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,\nTHE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE\nWRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,\nINDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND\nTHE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE\nPEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY\nBOMBINGS.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0004 (NCCOSC)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "1 (OPTIONAL)", "INCIDENT: DATE": "- 08 JAN 90", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "EL SALVADOR", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "-", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "-", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "\"AIR FORCE\"", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "REPORTED AS FACT: \"AIR FORCE\"", "PHYS TGT: ID": "-", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "-", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "-", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "-", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-", "HUM TGT: NAME": "\"ARNULFO ROMERO\"", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "\"MONSIGNOR\": \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; \"SALVADORANS\"; \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "CIVILIAN: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"; CIVILIAN: \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; CIVILIAN: \"SALVADORANS\"", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "1: \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; 70000: \"SALVADORANS\"; PLURAL: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "DEATH: \"JESUIT PRIESTS\"; DEATH: \"ARNULFO ROMERO\"; DEATH: \"SALVADORANS\"", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-"}}, {"text": "   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS)-- [TEXT] A WAR BULLETIN\nINDICATES THAT ON 6 JANUARY AT 1625, FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL\nLIBERATION FRONT] TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE CAVALRY COMPANY IN FINCA\nSANTA ELENA, SANTA TECLA, NEAR SAN SALVADOR, KILLING THREE AND\nWOUNDING FOUR ENEMY TROOPS, INCLUDING THE PATROL LEADER WHO WAS AMONG\nTHOSE KILLED.

INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN\nCOUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED\nSTATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST.  THE SIDE\nEFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE\nCOOPERATING.  ALTERNATIVELY, WOULD IT BE BETTER IF THEY DID NOT COOPERATE IN\nTHIS PHASE?\n\n   COULD IT BE THAT WHAT WE HAVE CALLED IMPERIALISTIC CLUMSINESS,\nINSENSIBILITY, AND ABUSE, IS SIMPLY A DELIBERATE STRATEGY WITH WHICH,\nPERHAPS FOR WELL FOUNDED REASONS AND EVEN AT THE RISK OF DIPLOMATIC\nCONFLICTS, THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ISOLATE LATIN AMERICA ON PURPOSE AND\nTHUS ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ITS OPERATION?

THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING\nITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF\nLATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR.\n\n   IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE\nUNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.

AS WE\nSAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS\nIN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  THE U.S. PROPOSAL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE:\nCOULD A WORLD POWER LIKE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IGNORE A SERIOUS\nPROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS, MERELY\nTO AVOID HARMING LATIN AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES, SENSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES\nWHOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS MUDDLED UP IN USELESS DIPLOMATIC AND\nBUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES AND FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS?

THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS,\nWERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE\nCRIME.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE\nCASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION],\nMONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.S. AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR\nTHE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE\nWERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP\nTHE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   2. TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE\nTHIS CASE.  THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM\nSHOULD BE PUNISHED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT\nTHE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS.  MOST\nIMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS\nBECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF\nTHE TOP COMMAND.\n\n   3. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS\nCONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE\nOF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND\nORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND\nSTOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS.  \n\n   4. THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED\nDISCUSSIONS ON U.S. AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS\nAID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR.  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE\nRESOLVED.  SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE\nTHAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN.  THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A\nNEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID.  WE APPEAL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MAKE\nTHIS DECISION.  IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING\nEFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.\n\n   5. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING\nPROGRESS.  IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE\nCOULD BE REACHED EARLIER.\n\n   6. TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN\nSECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH\nUS AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE\nDIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS.\n\n   7. THE FMLN WILL BE WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS.  IT URGES\nNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO EXERT PRESSURE SO THAT THE\nINVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A DECLARATION OF INTENTION OR WITH\nSTATEMENTS BLAMING LOW-RANKING SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST\nRESPONSIBLE.

ENDING THE YEAR, THE\nWORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.\n\n   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR\nADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI\nHIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE\nJESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT\nTHE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY\nFOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE\nONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.\nTHE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL\nTELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.  [PASSAGE\nINDISTINCT]...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.\n\n   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000\nPEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN\nZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION\nFEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN\nCRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD\nHAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS\nMADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.  \n\n   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,\nIS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA\nRICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE\nNATION WOULD DO SO.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT\nTHE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.\n\n   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE\nIRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN\n$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR\nARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED\nMONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S.\nADVISERS.  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN\nHE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.  THE 10 YEARS OF\nAID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.\nIF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE\nTIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.\n\n   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON\nTHE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT\nFOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?  IT IS A\nDECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.  IT WILL DETERMINE THE\nCONTINUATION OF U.S. AID.  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY\nAROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE TO\nDISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF\nTHE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE\nAS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT\nTHESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.\n\n   WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE\nSALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?  WILL THEY DO THIS\nBY STOPPING MILITARY AID?  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED\nSTATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A\nCOMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.

THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER\nOF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY\nMOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES\nTHE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE\nARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?\n\n   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING\nSCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE\nATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS\nPRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON\nJIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES\nOF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM\nIS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME\nGUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF\nOUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED\nAND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON\nIN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.\nWE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,\nWHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE\nOURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE\nINTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL\nRIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE\nWE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL\nELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE\nINFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY\nINDEPENDENT.\n\n   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY\nSECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING\nVIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING\nEXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US\nTO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\nATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN\nONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN\nCOUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS\nTHE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED\nEXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT\nTHIS STAGE...\n\n   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.\n\n   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT\nTHE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF\nDEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT\nTHAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST\nDO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.\n\n   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH\nMUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH\nINITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS\nWITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT\nABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO\nPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,\nBECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR\nGOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.\n\n   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT\nGOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS\nRELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT\nAT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.\nWHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'\nDEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC\nEMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS\nSHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE\nMEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?\n\n   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO\nINVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A\nROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT\nWAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH\nPENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK\nABOUT THIS?\n\n   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN\nMAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS\nBEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE\nBECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN\nTHE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS\nHAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE\nLOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT\nEVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS\nDRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL\nTHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY\nTHE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE\nFOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE\nAUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL\nBY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION\nALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE\nREVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON\nCUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?\n\n   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD\nONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS\nATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ\nMARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO\nTHE CRIME PROBLEM.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE\nCOUNTRY.\n\n   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE\nAUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT\nIS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE\nALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?\n\n   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.", "template": {"MESSAGE: ID": "DEV-MUC3-0045 (NCCOSC)", "MESSAGE: TEMPLATE": "1", "INCIDENT: DATE": "- 26 JAN 89", "INCIDENT: LOCATION": "HONDURAS", "INCIDENT: TYPE": "ATTACK", "INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION": "ACCOMPLISHED", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT ID": "-", "INCIDENT: INSTRUMENT TYPE": "-", "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY": "TERRORIST ACT", "PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID": "\"PROFESSIONALS\"", "PERP: ORGANIZATION ID": "-", "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE": "-", "PHYS TGT: ID": "-", "PHYS TGT: TYPE": "-", "PHYS TGT: NUMBER": "-", "PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "-", "PHYS TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-", "HUM TGT: NAME": "\"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"", "HUM TGT: DESCRIPTION": "\"[RETIRED] GENERAL\": \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"", "HUM TGT: TYPE": "FORMER ACTIVE MILITARY: \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"", "HUM TGT: NUMBER": "1: \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"", "HUM TGT: FOREIGN NATION": "-", "HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT": "DEATH: \"GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ\"", "HUM TGT: TOTAL NUMBER": "-"}}, {"text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [COMMUNIQUE] [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION ALLIANCE\n(AAA)] [TEXT] THE ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION ALLIANCE [ALIANZA DE ACCION\nANTICOMUNISTA] REPORTS THE FOLLOWING TO THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, IN\nPARTICULAR, AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN GENERAL:\n\n   1.
