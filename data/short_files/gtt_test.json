(passage omitted)   col quintero did not have a police escort. just 8 days ago he decided to dismiss the escort, because he did not want anyone else to be killed if there were an attack on him. only col quintero and a police driver were in the vehicle.   the judge of the 76th district court, who directed the removal of the body, said that several types of weapons were used in the attack and more than 100 shots were fired.
